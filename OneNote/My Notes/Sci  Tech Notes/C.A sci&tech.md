- ![space Science New Tool to Generate Infrared Star Catalogue for TMT pefence Technology India Launches First Advanced Frigate 'Triput' space Science New Tool to Generate Infrared Star Catalogue for TMT On 100 July, 2024, Department of Science & Technology, Government of India, informed that Indian researchers have developed an open-source tool to generate an infrared star catalogue, enhancing the Adaptive Optics System (AOS) of the upcoming Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). This tool is crucial for achieving sharper astronomical im- ages, contributing significantly to this international project. TMT Project Overview International Collaboration: The TMT is a major global initiative involving India, the United States, Canada, China, and Japan, aiming to revolutionize our under- standing of the universe with a 30-meter primary mirror and advanced instruments. • Scientific Goals: The telescope will study the early uni- verse, galaxy formation and evolution, the relationship between supermassive black holes and galaxies, star and planetary system formation, and exoplanet atmospheres. KEY FEATURES OF THE TMT Mirror System: Comprising a 30-meter primary mirror made of 492 hexagonal segments, a secondary mirror with 118 segments, and a centrally positioned tertiary mirror measuring 3.5 by 2.5 meters. Adaptive Optics System (AOS): Known as the Narrow Field Infrared Adaptive Optics System able mirr (NFIRA guide stars to correct atmospheric turbulence, thus enhancing image resolution. India's Contribution and Significance Major Contributions: India, through institutions like the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru, the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics ORDO Unveils 'Zorawar' Light Tank ORDO Successfully Tests HEAT 'ABHYAS' Biotechnology Asia's First Health Research-related Pre-Clinical Network Facility Computer Technology Global Disruption in Microsoft Cloud Services Information Technology Centre of Excellence on "Classical and Quantum Com- munications for 6G" Energy Technology World's First Hydrogen-powered Commercial Ferry (IUCAA), Pune, and the Aryabhatta Research Institute for Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital, is a key and funding worth $200 million. Innovative Tool Development: The automated code developed by Indian researchers will enable the TMT's AOS to use Natural Guide Stars (NGS) for correcting atmosphenT'äGäää'äTG'FfiTEF•11ty astronomi- cal imaging. Primary and Alternative Sites: While Mauna Kea in Hawaii is the preferred site due to its optimal conditions, alternative sites like the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos in the Canary Islands are being considered due to cultural and environmental concerns. Q. What is the primary role of the Narrow Field Infrared Adaptive Optics System (NFIRAOS) in the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT)? (a) Correcting atmospheric effects (b) Generating star catalogue (c) Studying exoplanets (d) Building mirror segments Ans: (a) Defence Technology India Launches First Advanced Frigate 'Triput' On 24th July, 2024, the Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL) launched the first of two advanced frigates being built with Russian technology for the Indian Navy. It has been named Triput. • The name Triput symbolizes a powerful arrow that represents the Indian Navy's striking capabilities. • India had originally contracted four frigates from Russia in October 2016, with two to be constructed in Russia and two at GSL. The first ship from Russia, named Tushil, is expected to be delivered to the Indian Navy in September 2024, with the second, Tamal, scheduled for February 2025.

SEBEX 2, created by Solar Industries' subsidiary Eco- nomic Explosives Limited, has been approved by the Indian Navy, promising to boost the effectiveness of military ordnance without increasing weight. SEBEX 2 's certification enhances India's export capabili- ties in advanced munitions, appealing to military forces worldwide seeking to upgrade their weapon systems. SEBEX 2's TNT equivalence of 2.01 makes it sig- nificantly more lethal than current explosives, such as thosejused in Brahmos warheads. The part of the Make in India initiative, enhances the destructive power of warheads, bombs, and artillery shells, crucial for effective target damage. EEL, the developer, is working on an even more power- ful variant with a TNT equivalence of 2.3, expected in six months. The Navy has also certified SITBEX V, a thermobaric explosive for destroying bunkers, and SIMEX 4, a munition that is safer to handle and store. These advancements underline India's growing expertise in high-lethality military technology. ](Exported%20image%2020250424103907-1.jpeg) - ![DRDO Successfully Tests HEAT 'ABHYAS' In June 2024, the Defence Research and Development Organis sation (DRDO) successfully cornpleted six consecutive velopment trials ofthe High Speed Expendable Aerial Targq (HEAT) 'ABHYAS ' with an improved booster configuration at the Integrated Test Range (IT R) in Chandipur, Odisha. The recent trials bring the total to ten development tri. als, showcasing the system's reliability and enhanced capabilities. The trials featured improved Radar Cross Section Visual, and Infrared augmentation systems, validat. ing the ABHYAS's advanced features and capabilities. Mission objectives, including safe release of the booster, launcher clearance, and endurance performance, were successfully met during these trials. The system is designed for autonomous flying, sup. ported by an auto-pilot and a laptop-based Ground Control System, facilitating aircraft integration, pre-fligh checks, and autonomous flight. Data recording during flight allowsfor detailed post- flight analysis, enhancing the system's utility for testing and evaluation. Developed by DRDO's Aeronautical Development Es- tablishment and manufactured by Hindustan AeronaUt• ics Limited and Larsen & Toubro, ABHYAS provides a realistic threat scenario for weapon system practice• The booster for ABHYAS was designed by the Advanced Systems Laboratory, while the navigation system was developed by Research Centre Imarat. ](Exported%20image%2020250424103909-2.jpeg) - ![つ 鬥 "%/dxa 。 、 ~ 1 。 ~ 生 G TX ヨ 9 ユ て s を ( 工 主 9 け 亠 ー っ 可 ゴ 創 ユ 十 あ 尸 ~ 尸 っ ョ ョ 甲 . 当 下 一 平 。 の dB つ , 岬 ↓ ヂ 。 つ 。 。 十 に 卩 に 」 。 爿 ~ ・ カ , 。 卩 。 卩 罅 ~ 。 卩 勹 ・ 0 ュ フ ~ 。 辟 尸 ー ユ ( 発 冖 せ ー 5 ド れ 广 を を ド 上 負 ュ を フ 怦 十 ツ 匀 。 v 刀 ュ ヤ 社 0 (J 0 ア の C' 平 50W ュ せ " ル ” 。 50U ](Exported%20image%2020250424103914-3.jpeg) - ![-s مهA الأعما هط ستلل eeالاء) تصع/ عمصهو عكل اص و: اتك مد الص لهك-مصما ة Alt-I أcص-لR اهومتلماهههيي لمعحعمة In فه- ](Exported%20image%2020250424103916-4.jpeg)
