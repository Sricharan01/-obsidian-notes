- Key Points to Remember:￼￼1. Young Workforce: India’s young population is driving its economic growth, but labor force participation is low, especially in manufacturing.￼￼￼2. Reforms and Manufacturing: Continued reforms and focus on labor-intensive sectors like manufacturing are crucial for job creation.￼￼￼3. Skilling: Only 4.4% of young workers are formally skilled. Continuous skilling and public-private partnerships are needed.￼￼￼4. AI/ML Impact: Automation threatens low-skilled jobs, but AI/ML presents significant opportunities for growth, requiring skilled labor.￼￼￼5. Harnessing Demographic Dividend: India must fully utilize its young population to drive future economic growth through jobs and skill development.￼
