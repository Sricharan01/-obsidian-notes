    - ![Climate Change Rising Carbon Emissions from Arctic Wildfires Throughout June 2024, several wildfires emerged within the Arctic Circle, with the majority of activity concentrated in RussiäTSäkF a Republic, which experienced severe wildfires in 202 Data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitorin S r- vice (CAMS) are the the past twenty years. Record Emissions High Emissions: June's wildfire carbon emissions in the Arctic reached the third-highest level in two decades at 6.8 megatonnes, trailing behind June 2020 and 2019. Area Affected: Over 160 wildfires scorched nearly 460,000 hectares in Sakha, Russia, by late June. Contributing Factors Rapid Arctic Warming: The Arctic is heating up ap- proximately four times faster than the global average, with temperatures increasing by about 30C since 1980. Lightning and Wildfires: Rising temperatures lead to more frequent lightning, significantly increasing wildfire likelihood. Lightning-sparked fires have more than doubled in regions like Alaska and the Northwest Territories since 1975. Polar Jet Stream Dynamics: A warming Arctic has slowed the polar jet stream, causing it to get "stuck" and bring unseasonably warm weather, which can exacerbate heatwaves and wildfires. Implications for Global Warming Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Wildfires release sig- nificant amounts of C02 and other greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. Wildfires damage the insulating vegetation layer on permafrost, making it more suscepti- ble to thawing. This can release vast amounts of carbon, stored in permafrost, into the atmosphere, potentially surpassing the carbon released by fossil fuels globally. Long-term Impact: If Arctic permafrost thaws exten- sively, it would be impossible to limit global warming to 1.50C, leading to irreversible consequences. Q. What potential consequence does large-scale permafrost thawing have on carbon release? (a) Carbon release could be minimal and reversible. (b) Carbon release could be stopped and controlled. 9-—Carbon release could be unstoppable and irreversible. (d) Carbon release would decrease over time. Ans: (c) Impact of Climate Change on Education and Child Development The Global Education Monitoring Report 2024, published by UNESCO in July 2024, underscores the profound long- term impact of climate change on children's education and development. The key findings and recommendations ofthe report have been outlined here.

- **Recommendations for Addressing Climate Impact on Education**￼￼Curriculum Integration: The report advocates for the inclusion of climate change education in school curricula, emphasizing knowledge of climate science, resilience, adaptation, and sustainable development skills.￼￼Proactive Measures: Suggested actions include fortify- ing school infrastructure, training educators to support students during climate-related challenges, and fostering community resilience through awareness and adaptation programs.￼￼Investment in Education Systems: The report calls for increased investment to enhance the resilience of educational systems to climate disruptions.￼
- **Potential Decline in Exploitable Fish Biomass****￼****￼**A new report published by the Food and Agriculture Organi- zation (**FAO**) on 10th July, 2024, forecasts a potential decline of 10 to 30 per cent or more in exploitable fish biomass by the end of the century if emissions are not curtailed.￼￼**Major Highlights****￼****￼****Predicted Impact on Fish Biomass**￼￼A new FAO report predicts a 10-30% decline in fish biomass by the end of the century if emissions aren't reduced.￼￼**High-Emissions Scenario:** With a 3-4°C temperature rise, fish biomass may drop by 10% by mid-century and over 30% in 48 countries by century-end.￼￼**Low-Emissions Scenario**: A 1.5-2°C rise could stabilize the decline to less than 10% in 178 countries.￼￼￼Regional Impacts:￼￼Asia: 60% of territories will face declines.￼￼Americas & Europe: Mixed results; some regions see severe losses.￼￼Africa & Oceania: Major declines expected.￼￼￼Key Countries: Major fish producers like China, India, and Peru will experience declines.￼￼Recommendations: Improve climate models and enhance tools for policy-making.
 
- **Annual Discovery Highlights**

**Fauna**: India added 641 new species to its fauna data- base in 2023, including 442 entirely new species and 199 newly recorded species. The majority of these were invertebrates (564 species), with only 77 vertebrates (mostly fish) being discovered.  
**Plant Life:** The plant database saw 339 new taxa, with326 species and 13 infraspecific taxa. This includes 171 taxa new to science and 168 new distributional records. Notable new plant discoveries include Asystasia venuiin West Bengal.
 - ![uropeltis caudomaculata 4) öe-Dt6e56 O In English Kozhikode: A new species of snake, distinguished by its yellow-spotted tail, has been discovered in the Western Ghats. Named Uropeltis caudomaculata or shield-tail snake, these non- venomous serpents are notable for their distinct tail markings. 10 Jul 2024 ](Exported%20image%2020250424103854-1.jpeg)
- It is named Uropeltis caudomalculata due to the distinct tmyellow spot at the base of its tail. This new species is found exclusively along the eastern escarpment of the Western Ghats, from Meghamalai Tiger Reserve in Tamil Nadu to Periyar Tiger Reserve and Yellapetty in Munnar, Kerala. The team's research included DNA sequencing, which was crucial in identifying the genetic differences between Uropeltis caudomaculata and its relatives.
- Color patterns are the main distinguishtion from similiar species.
      

**White Category Industries :**
 
- On 19th July, 2024, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change issued draft notifications that could exempt "white category' industries from obtaining prior permissions under the Air Act, 1981, and the Water Act, 1974.
- On July 19, 2024, the Ministry of Environment proposed draft notifications that could exempt "white category" industries, considered non-polluting, from needing certain permits.￼￼**Proposed Exemptions:****￼****￼****No Permits Required**: "White category" industries may not need permission (CTE or CTO) from State Pollution Control Boards to operate.￼￼**Merging Permits:** For projects needing environmental clearance, CTE permits could be combined with environmental clearance conditions.￼￼￼**Reasons for the Changes:**￼￼Legal Updates: These changes are based on recent laws that reduced penalties under the Air and Water Acts, replacing jail time with fines.￼￼Simplifying Rules: The goal is to reduce bureaucracy for low-pollution industries like **wind and solar power, air cooler, and bicycle assembly.**

**Pollution Index Score:** The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) introduced the 'white category' in 2016, classifying industries with a Pollution Index (PI) score of up to 20 as 'white'. This score is determined by fac- tors such as emissions, effluent discharge, and resource consumption.￼

    1. UNESCO warns of severe Land Degradation.
        
        1. On July 1, 2024, UNESCO warned that 90% of the planet's land could be degraded by 2050, severely threatening biodiversity and human life.￼￼Key Points:￼￼**Call for Action:** At a conference in Morocco, UNESCO's Director-General urged its 194 member states to prioritize soil protection and rehabilitation.￼￼**Importance of Soil**: Soil is essential for life, supporting ecosystems, producing food, purifying water, and regulating climate, yet it is poorly managed.￼￼**Current Situation:** 75% of soils are already degraded, affecting 3.2 billion people, and could reach 90% by 2050, endangering food security and biodiversity.￼Soil degradation threatens food security biodiversity and the livelihoods of millions of people world wide.
          
        
        (ANDZOA) UNESCO and Morocco organized a conference with experts from 30 countries to create a plan for soil protection and rehabilitation.￼￼**Goals**:￼￼Develop a plan to protect and restore soil.￼￼Address knowledge gaps and involve youth and communities through education and training.￼￼￼**UNESCO Initiatives**:￼￼**World Soil Health Index**: UNESCO will create a global index to compare soil quality and track degradation.￼￼**Pilot Program:** UNESCO Biosphere Reserves will test the best soil conservation practices.￼￼**Training and Education**: UNESCO will train government agencies and communities on soil conservation, focusing on involving youth in the process.
