    1. From 15th century onwards, three important developments had changed the shape of Europe: (i) the invention of printing press, (ii) the beginning and the spread of the Renaissance and the Reformation movements and (iii) the discovery of new trade routes. Thereafter, Europe made great progress in the fields of science, exploration and gunnery. Soon, their armies and navies became the best in the world. Scientific education began to spread. Logic and reason thus became the touchstone on which the old dogmas and learning were tested.
    2. British domination of India was built upon successive phases. The first phase consisted of taking hold of the Indian trade. They bought Indian goods at very low prices and sold them in the Western markets at very high prices, thereby making enormous profits without giving anything to the peasants. In this, they were helped by the Indian Seths and gomastas
    3. In the second phase, the British took control of the production activities in a manner that would suit their export objectives. In the process they successfully destroyed the Indian industries. The third phase was an intensified phase of British imperialism and colonial exploitation when India was ruled by the British for fulfilling British economic interests.

        4. Akbar’s attempt to introduce secular and scientific system of education was not liked by the orthodox sections. Akbar’s efforts ushered in a change which continued for centuries
        5. Akbar patronized many scholars such as Abul Fazal, Faizi, Raja Todar Mal, Birbal and Rahim. They were among the nine gems of his court who helped in spreading culture and education.
    8. Modern period - East India Company’s Charter Act of 1813 enabled the Company to set aside one lakh rupees for “the revival and improvement of literature and the encouragement of learned natives of India and for the introduction and promotion of a knowledge of sciences among the inhabitants of the British territories in India”
        
        1. Debate ensued between the Orientalists and the Anglicists which was finally settled by **Macaulay’s Minutes and Bentinck’s Resolution of 1835**. It was decided that this fund would be utilized to promote European literature and sciences. William Bentinck adopted English as the official language of the government.
        2. Wood’s Despatch of 1854 underlined the **objective of educational policy** which was the diffusion of “the improved arts, sciences, philosophy and literature of Europe” through English or other modern Indian languages as the medium.
        3. Under the Colonial Rule, **mass education was neglected** and the attempt was to create an urban educated elite that would act as interpreter between the ruler and the ruled. Examination system was emphasized in both high schools and Universities. The impact of English education was not even.
        4. However, use of English by Indians provided one language that cut across the entire country and became a common link for them. English books and newspapers brought to them new ideas from across the sea
    9. Post Independence - **Kothari Commission 1966** referred to education as the only instrument of peaceful social change. To this end, the Constitutional Amendment of 1976 included education in the concurrent list, that is, the center and states both assume joint responsibility of education. ￼
6. Religion & Philosophy in Ancient India
    
    1. Philosophy arose in India as an enquiry into the mystery of life and existence. Indian sages called Rishis or ‘seers’, **developed special techniques of transcending the sense and the ordinary mind, collectively called yoga**.
        
        1. With the help of these techniques, they delved **deep into the depths of consciousness** and discovered important truths about the true nature of human being and the universe (_got really stoned basically)_
        2. Sages found that the true nature of the human being is **not the body or the mind**, which are ever changing and perishable but the **spirit which is unchanging, immortal and pure consciousness**. They called it the Atman
        3. Atman is the **true source of human’s knowledge,** happiness and power. The rishis further found that all individual selves are **parts of infinite consciousness which they called Brahman**. Brahman is the ultimate reality, the ultimate cause of the universe. Ignorance of human’s true nature is the main cause of human suffering and bondage. By gaining correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman, it is possible to **become free from suffering and bondage and attain** a state of immortality, everlasting peace and fulfillment known as Moksha.
        4. Thus philosophy provided a **correct view of reality**, while religion showed the **correct way of life**; philosophy provided the vision, while religion brought about the fulfillment; philosophy was the theory, and religion was the practice. Thus in ancient India, **philosophy and religion complemented** each other.
    2. Pre and proto-historic sites it seems that these people believed in the sanctity of the creative force and venerated the male and female aspects of divinity. It appears that they were **worshippers of the forces of nature** like the sun and the moon
        
        1. believed in many gods like Indra, Varuna, Agni, Surya and Rudra. Sacrifices, and ritual offering of food and drink to fire in honor of the Gods, constituted the main religious practices.
    3. Unorthodox movements - **ignored the infallibility and supernatural origin of the Vedas.** Unlike the Vedic seers who were Brahmin sages, many of these new teachers were **Kshatriya**. Both Buddhism and Jainism were **atheistic creeds** in the beginning. However, Buddhism endorsed the doctrine of the **Law of Karma** and upheld the **belief in rebirths** of the embodied skandhas and the inevitability of suffering in the very existence of beings. Many of these view points are also found in the major Upanishads.
    4. Folk cults - worship o**f Yakshas and Nagas** and other folk deities constituted the most important part of primitive religious beliefs, **in which Bhakti had a very important role to play**. There is ample evidence about the prevalence of this form of worship among the people in early literature as well as in archaeology
    5. Vasudeva/Krishna - large number of people worshipped Vasudeva Krishna exclusively **as their personal God** and they were at first known as **Bhagavatas**. It grew steadily, absorbing within its fold **other Vedic and Brahminic divinities** like **Vishnu** (primarily an aspect of the sun) and **Narayana** (a cosmic God). From the late Gupta period the name mostly **used to designate this Bhakti cult was Vaishnava**
        
        1. Vaishnava poet-saints known as Alvars (a Tamil word denoting those drowned in Vishnu-bhakti) preached **single-minded devotion** (ekatmika bhakti) for Vishnu and their songs were collectively known as **prabandhas**.
    6. Shaivism - Unlike Vaishnavism, Shaivism had its origin in **antiquity**. Panini refers to a group of Shiva worshippers as **Shiva-bhagavatas,** who were characterized by the iron lances and clubs they carried and their skin garments.
        
        1. Shaiva movement in the South flourished at the beginning through the activities of many of the **63 saints known in Tamil as Nayanars** (Siva-bhakts). Their appealing emotional songs in Tamil were called **Tevaram** Stotras, also known as Dravida Veda and ceremonially sung in the local Shiva temples. The Nayanars hailed from **all castes**.
        2. Other several forms of Shaiva movements - Agamanta, Shudha and Vira-shaivism
    7. Vedic philosophy - during the later Vedic period that definite ideas and philosophies about the true nature of soul or Atman and the cosmic principle or Brahman who represented the ultimate reality were developed. These Vedic philosophical concepts later on gave rise to **six different schools of philosophies** called **shada darshana**. They fall in the category of the **orthodox** system as the **final authority of the Vedas is recognized by all of them**
        
        1. Samkhya philosophy - holds that reality is constituted of two principles one **female and the other male i**.e. Prakriti, Purusha respectively. **Metaphysical dualism**, but unlike many Western counterparts it is **atheistic**. Prakriti and Purusha are completely independent and absolute.
            
            1. According to this system, **Purusha** is mere consciousness, hence it **cannot** be modified or changed. **Prakriti** on the other hand is constituted of three attributes, thought, movement and the change or transformation of these attributes **brings about the change** in all objects.
            2. Samkhya philosophy tries to establish some relationship between Purusha and Prakriti for explaining the creation of the universe. Propounded by **Kapila**, who wrote the Samkhya sutra.
        2. **Yoga** - Yoga literally means the **union of the two principal entities**. The origin of yoga is found in the Yogasutra of Patanjali believed to have been written in the 2nd BCE. By purifying and controlling changes in the mental mechanism, yoga systematically brings about the release of **purusha from prakriti**.
            
            1. Yogic techniques **control the body, mind and sense organs**. Thus this philosophy is also considered a means of **achieving freedom or mukti**. This freedom could be attained by practicing self-control (**yama**), observation of rules (**niyama**), fixed postures (**asana**), breath control (**pranayama**), choosing an object (**pratyahara**) and fixing the mind (**dharna**), concentrating on the chosen object (**dhyana**) and complete dissolution of self, merging the mind and the object (**samadhi**).
            2. Yoga admits the existence of God as a teacher and guide.
        3. **Nyaya** - Nyaya is considered as a technique of **logical thinking**. According to Nyaya, **valid knowledge is defined as the real knowledge**, that is, one knows about the object as it exists. For example, it is when one knows a snake as a snake or a cup as a cup.
            
            1. Nyaya system of philosophy **considers God who creates, sustains and destroys** the universe. **Gautama** is said to be the author of the Nyaya Sutras.
        4. **Vaisheshika** - gives us the **principles of reality which constitute the universe.** System is considered as the **realistic and objective philosophy** of universe. The reality has many **bases or categories** which are substance, attribute, action, genus, distinct quality and inherence.
            
            1. Vaisheshika thinkers believe that **all objects of the universe are composed of five elements–earth, water, air, fire and ether.** They believe that **God** is the guiding principle. The living beings were rewarded or punished according to the **law of karma.**
            2. **Kanada** wrote the basic text of **Vaisheshika** philosophy
        5. **Mimamsa** - philosophy is basically the **analysis** of **interpretation, application** and the use of the text of the Samhita and Brahmana portions of the Veda.
            
            1. According to Mimamsa philosophy **Vedas are eternal and possess all knowledge,** and religion means the fulfilment of duties prescribed by the Vedas.
            2. This philosophy encompasses the **Nyaya-Vaisheshika systems** and emphasizes the concept of valid knowledge.
            3. Its main text is known as the Sutras of **Jamini** which have been written during the third century BC.
        6. **Vedanta** implies the philosophy of the Upanishad, the concluding portion of the Vedas.
            
            1. **Shankaracharya** wrote the commentaries on the Upanishads, Brahmasutras and the Bhagavad Gita. Shankaracharya’s discourse or his philosophical views came to be known as **Advaita Vedanta**. Advaita literally means non-dualism or belief in one reality. Shankaracharya expounded that **ultimate reality is one, it being the Brahman**.
            2. Shankaracharya believes that the **Brahman is existent, unchanging, the highest truth and the ultimate knowledge.** He also believes that there is no distinction between Brahman and the self. The knowledge of Brahman is the essence of all things and the ultimate existence. **Ramanuja** was another well known Advaita scholar.
        7. Vedanta philosophy has ventured to **deny the existence of the apparent ego**, as known to us, and in this respect Vedanta has its **unique position** in the history of philosophies of the world. Core message of Vedanta is that every action must be **governed by the intellect** – the discriminating faculty. The mind makes mistakes but the intellect tells us if the action is in our interest or not
    8. Charvaka - **Brihaspati** is supposed to be the founder of the Charvaka School of philosophy and Ajita Kesakambali is credited as the forerunner of the Charvakas. It finds **mention** in the **Vedas and Brihadaranyka Upanishad**. Thus it is supposed to be the **earliest in the growth of the philosophical knowledge**. It holds that knowledge is the product of the combination of four elements which **leaves no trace after death.**
        
        1. Charvaka philosophy deals with the **materialistic philosophy**. It is also known as the **Lokayata** Philosophy - the philosophy of the masses. According to Charvaka there is **no other world.** Hence, death is the end of humans and **pleasure the ultimate object in life.**
        2. **Except for Charvaka school**, realization of soul has been the common goal of all philosophical schools of India.
    9. Jains - Like the Charvakas, the Jains too do not believe in the Vedas, but they admit the **existence of a soul**. They also agree with the orthodox tradition that suffering (pain) can be **stopped by controlling the mind** and by seeking right knowledge and perception and by observing the right conduct. Jaina philosophy was first propounded by the Tirthankara Rishabha Deva.
        
        1. There were 24 tirthankaras who actually established the Jaina darshan. The first tirthankar realized that the source of Jaina philosophy was **Adinath**. The 24th and the last Tirthankara was named Vardhaman Mahavira who gave great impetus to Jainism. Mahavira was born in 599 BC
        2. Jains believe that the natural and supernatural things of the universe can be traced back to **7 fundamental elements. They are jiva, ajivaa, astikaya, bandha, samvara, nirjana, and moksa.**
        3. Right Knowledge (as per Mahavira) is the **acceptance of the theory that there is no God** and that the world has been existing without a creator and that **all objects possess a soul.** Right conduct (Jainism) refers to the observance of the five great vows such as not to injure life, not to lie, not to steal, not to acquire property and not to lead an immoral life
        4. Jain ethical code prescribes five fundamental vows - **Ahims****a (Non-violence) Satya (Truth) Asteya (Non-stealing) Brahmacharya (Chastity) Aparigraha (Non-possession****)**
        5. Samayasara and the Pravacanasara are considered the bible of **Digambaras**
    10. Buddha - born in 563 BC at **Lumbini,** a village near Kapilavastu in the foothills of Nepal. His childhood name was Siddhartha.
        
        1. Gautama’s 3 main disciples known as **Upali, Ananda and Mahakashyapa** remembered his teachings and passed them on to his followers. It is believed that soon after the Buddha’s death a council was called at Rajagriha where **Upali recited the Vinaya Pitaka** (rules of the order) and **Ananda recited the Sutta Pitaka (Buddha’s sermons or doctrines and ethics)**. Sometime later the **Abhidhamma Pitaka** consisting of the Buddhist philosophy came into existence
        2. He considered the world as full of misery. Man’s **duty is to seek liberation from this painful world.** He strongly criticized blind faith in the traditional scriptures like the Vedas.
        3. Realization of Four Noble Truths. The knowledge realized by Buddha is reflected in the following four noble truths:
            
            1. There is suffering in human life.
            2. Desire is the fundamental cause of suffering.
            3. There is cessation of suffering when passion, desire and love of life are totally destroyed
            4. Path leading to liberation is **eight-fold,** through which one can attain nirvana
        4. Buddha suggested eight fold path for liberation. These are: (i) right vision (ii) right resolve (iii) right speech (iv) right conduct (v) right means of livelihood (vi) right effort (vii) right mindfulness and (viii) right concentration. (vrsclemc)
        5. Buddhism sheds any discussion on God and soul as futile. Buddha also taught that the **soul does not exist**
        6. **Sautr****āntika**, ancient school of Buddhism that emerged in India about the 2nd century BC as an offshoot of the **Sarv****a****stivada** (“All-Is-Real Doctrine”). The school is so called because of its reliance on the sutras, or words of the Buddha, and its **rejection of the authority of the Abhidhamma**, a part of the canon.
            
            1. Sautrāntikas maintained that though events (dharmas) have only momentary existence, there is a **transmigrating substratum of consciousness** that contains within it seeds of goodness that are in every person.
            2. Sautrāntika sometimes is characterized as a **transitional school that led to the development of the Mahāyāna tradition**, and many of its views influenced later Yogācāra thought.
            3. Mahayana tradition is the largest major tradition of Buddhism existing today, with 53.2% of practitioners (East Asia), compared to 35.8% for Theravada (SE Asia) and 5.7% for **Vajrayana** (Tibet, Mongolia)
    11. **Ajivika**, an **ascetic sect** that emerged in India about the **same time as Buddhism and Jainism and that lasted until the 14th century;** the name may mean “following the ascetic way of life.” It was founded by **Goshala Maskariputra** (also called Gosala Makkhaliputta), a **friend of Mahavira.**￼
7. Medieval India
    
    1. Sufis were mystics who called for **liberalism in Islam**. They emphasized on an egalitarian society based on universal love. The Bhakti saints transformed Hinduism by introducing devotion or bhakti as the means to attain God. For them caste had no meaning and all human being’s were equal. Sufi and Bhakti saints played an important role in bringing the Muslims and Hindus together. By using the local language of the people, they made religion accessible and meaningful to the common people.
    2. Among the Sunnis, there are four principal schools of Islamic Law, These are based upon the **Quran and Hadis** (traditions of the Prophet’s saying and doings). Of these the **Hanafi** school of the 8th century was adopted by the eastern Turks, who later came to India.
    3. Sufis laid emphasis upon free thought and liberal ideas. They were against formal worship, rigidity and fanaticism in religion. The Sufis turned to meditation in order to achieve religious satisfaction. Like the Bhakti saints, the Sufis too interpreted religion as ‘love of god’ and service of humanity.
        
        1. In course of time, the Sufis were divided into **different silsilahs (orders)** with each silsilah having its own pir (guide) called Khwaja or Sheikh. The pir and his disciples lived in a **khanqah (hospice)**. A pir nominated a successor or wali from his disciples to carry on his work. The Sufis organized **samas** (a recital of holy songs) to arouse mystical ecstasy.
        2. One of the early Sufis of eminence, who settled in India, was Al-Hujwari popularly known as **Data Ganj Baksh** (Distributor of Unlimited Treasure)
    4. In the beginning, the main centers of the Sufis were Multan and Punjab. By the 13th-14th centuries, the Sufis had spread to Kashmir, Bihar, Bengal and the Deccan.
        
        1. Sufism had already taken on a definite **form before coming** to India. Its fundamental and moral principles, teachings and orders, system of fasting, prayers and practice of living in khanqahs had already been fixed
    5. Silsilahs were divided into two types: **Ba-shara** **and** **Be-shara****.** Ba-shara were those orders that followed the Islamic Law (Sharia) and its directives such as **namaz and roza**. Chief amongst these were the **Chishti, Suhrawardi, Firdawsi, Qadiri and Naqshbandi silsilahs.** The **beshara silsilahs were not bound by the Sharia. The Qalandars** belonged to this group
    6. Chishti order was founded in a village called **Khwaja Chishti** (near Herat). In India, the Chishti silsilah was founded by **Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti** (born c. 1142) who came to India around 1192. He made **Ajmer** the main center for his teaching.
        
        1. Sheikh Fariduddin of Ajodhan (Pattan in Pakistan) popularized the Chishti silsilah in modern Haryana and Punjab. He opened his door of love and generosity to all. **Baba Farid, as he was called, was respected by both Hindus and Muslims**. His verses, written in Punjabi, are quoted in the Adi Granth
        2. **Baba Farid’s most famous disciple Shaikh Nizamuddin Auliya** (1238-1325) was responsible for making Delhi an important center of the Chishti silsilah.
        3. Another famous Chishti saint was Sheikh Nasiruddin Mahmud, popularly known as **Nasiruddin Chirag-i-Dilli** (The Lamp of Delhi). Following his death in 13 56 and the lack of a spiritual successor, the disciples of the Chishti silsilah moved out towards eastern and southern India.
    7. **Suhrawardi** Silsilah - was founded by **Sheikh Shihabuddin Suhrawardi**. It was established in India by **Sheikh Bahauddin Zakariya**. Unlike the Chishti saints, the Suhrawardis maintained **close contacts with the state.**
    8. A notable contribution of the Sufis was their service to the poorer and downtrodden sections of society. While the Sultan and ulema often remained aloof from the day to day problems of the people, the Sufi saints maintained close contact with the common people
    9. Most notable writer of this period was Amir Khusrau (14th CE) the follower of Nizamuddin Auliya. Khusrau took pride in being an Indian and looked at the history and culture of Hindustan as a part of his own tradition.
    10. Development of Bhakti movement took place in Tamil Nadu between the 7th-12th centuries
        
        1. It was reflected in the emotional poems of the Nayanars (devotees of Shiva) and Alvars (devotees of Vishnu). These saints looked upon religion not as a cold formal worship **but as a loving bond based** upon love between the worshipped and worshipper.
        2. They wrote in local languages, Tamil and Telugu and were therefore able to reach out to many people.
    11. Bhakti saints translated Sanskrit works to make them understandable to a wider audience.
        
        1. **Jnanadeva writing in Marathi**; Kabir, Surdas and Tulsidas in Hindi; **Shankaradeva** popularizing **Assamese; Chaitanya and Chandidas spreading their message in Bengali; Mirabai in Hindi and Rajasthani.**
    12. Kabir, Namdev and Guru Nanak had preached devotion toward a **nirankar** form of God
        
        1. Kabir believed that the way to God was through personally experienced bhakti or devotion. He believed that the **Creator is One.** His God was called by many names - Rama, Hari, Govinda, Allah, Rahim, Khuda, etc. No wonder then that the Muslims claim him as Sufi, the Hindus call him Rama-Bhakta and the Sikhs incorporate his songs in the Adi Granth. The external aspects of religion were meaningless for Kabir
        2. Guru Nanak’s personality combined in itself simplicity and peacefulness. Guru Nanak’s objective was to **remove the existing corruption and degrading practices in society**. He showed a new path for the establishment of an egalitarian social order
        3. Although Kabir and Nanak had **no intention of founding new religions** but following their deaths, their supporters grouped together as Kabir panthis and Sikhs respectively
    13. **Vaishnavite** movement, centered around the worship of Rama and Krishna, who were seen as incarnations (avatars) of Lord Vishnu. Its main exponents were **Surdas, Mirabai, Tulsidas and Chaitanya.** Their path to salvation was expressed through the medium of poetry, song, dance and kirtans.
        
        1. **Bhagvata Purana** became a turning point in the history of the **Vaishnavite** movement which was an important component of the Bhakti movement
        2. Surdas (1483-1563) was a disciple of the famous teacher, **Vallabhacharya**. He was a blind poet, whose songs are centered around Krishna. His **Sursagar** recounts the exploits of Krishna during his childhood and youth with gentle affection and delightfulness
        3. Vaishnavite movement spread in the **east through the efforts of Chaitanya** (1484- 1533). Chaitanya considered Krishna not as a mere incarnation of Vishnu but as the highest form of God. The devotion for Krishna was expressed through Sankirtans
        4. Worship of Rama was popularized by saints like **Ramananda** (1400-1470). He considered Rama as the supreme God. Women and outcastes were welcomed. The most famous of the Rama bhakts was Tulsidas (1532-1623) who wrote the Ramacharitmanas.
    14. Major religious movements were brought about by the mystics. They contributed to the religious ideas and beliefs. Bhakti saints like **Vallabhacharya, Ramanuja, Nimbaraka** brought about new philosophical thinking which had its origin in **Shankaracharya’s** advaita (non-dualism) philosophy.
        
        1. **Vishistadvaita** of Ramanujacharya - means **qualified non-dualism**. The ultimate reality according to this philosophy is Brahman (God), and matter and soul are his qualities.
        2. Sivadvaita of Srikanthacharya - ultimate Brahman is Shiva, endowed with Shakti. Shiva exists in this world as well as beyond it.
        3. Dvaita of **Madhavacharya** - literal meaning of **dvaita is dualism which stands in opposition to non-dualism and monism of Shankaracharya**. He believed that the **world is not an illusion (maya) but a reality full of differences.**
        4. Dvaitadvaita of **Nimbaraka** - means **dualistic monism**. According to this philosophy God transformed himself into **world and soul**. This world and soul are different from God (Brahman). They could survive with the support of God only. They are **separate but dependent.**
        5. Suddhadvaita of **Vallabhacharya** - he wrote commentaries on Vedanta Sutra and Bhagavad Gita. For him, Brahman (God) was Krishna who manifested himself as souls and matter. **God and soul are not distinct, but one**. The stress was on pure non-dualism
          
        
8. Society -
    
    1. Tribe is one of the earliest identifiable ethnic cum social organizations. In a tribe all members are equal in status, the Raja/King is first among equals.
        
        1. Tribes of Vedic period - **Bharatas, Yadus**, Turvasas, Druhyus, Purus and Anus
        2. 3 higher ‘varnas’ were also entitled to the sacred (**upanayana**) thread ceremony and were known as ‘dvijas’ **(twice-born**).
        3. Growth of urbanization, craft production, and trade resulted in the rise of guilds or ‘shreni’ which in later times became castes
        4. Customarily the guild (shreni-dharma) had the **power of law**. These guilds could act as bankers, financiers and trustees as well. Generally, these functions were carried out by a different category of merchants known as the ‘shreshthins’
        5. **Idangai (left hand, manufacturing) and Valangai** (**or right hand)**, agricultural basis) was a caste-based division of communities in South India that was in vogue from ancient times up to the 19th century.
    2. Untouchables - were sometimes called the **fifth varna (panchamd**). By the Gupta period their status fell so much that they were forced to further strike a wooden clapper on entering a town. **Mlechchas** (outsiders such as Sakas) were also considered untouchables.
    3. Slavery - Arthashastra states that a **man could be a slave by birth**, by **voluntarily** selling himself, by being **captured** in war, or as a result of a judicial **punishment**. Sanskrit word for slave is ‘dasa’. The masters had no rights over the lives of their slaves. There were **no slave markets** in the early periods.
    4. ‘Purushartha’ means aims of life which is **divided into four ‘ashramas’** or stages of life. For each of the ‘ashramas’ there are prescribed ‘samskaras’ or rites that need to be performed.
        
        1. Four aims of life ‘dharma’ (right conduct), ‘artha’ (pursuits through which livelihood is earned), ‘kama’ (worldly desires) and ‘moksha’ (salvation).
        2. First ‘ashrama’ is known as ‘brahmacharya’, which a person enters after the ‘upanayana sanskara’
        3. ‘Grihastha ashrama’ is the most important stage in a person’s life
        4. After discharging all the duties of a householder, he enters the ‘vanaprastha ashrama’ and tries to attain moksha
        5. Lastly he enters the ‘sanyasa ashrama’ in which he practices complete renunciation
    5. Family is primary unit of the society. The members of the family are bound together by ‘**shraddha**’, the rite of commemorating the ancestors. ‘_Shraddha_’ defined the family; those who were entitled to participate in the ceremony were ‘_sapindas_’, members of the family group.
        
        1. Family in India is governed by two schools of sacred law and customs. These are based on ‘_Mitakshara_’ and ‘_Dayabhaga_’. Most families of Bengal and Assam follow the rules of ‘**Dayabhaga**’ (son gets right to property on death of ancestors) while the rest of India generally follows ‘**Mitakshara**’ (son gets right to property on birth)
        2. Brahmanical law considered **marriage indissoluble after pheras, but ‘Arthashastra’ however, shows that in certain cases divorce was allowed.**
