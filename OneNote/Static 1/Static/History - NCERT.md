2. Class 7
    
    1. Tracing the changes bw 700 AD to 1750 AD
        
        1. **Al-Idrisi & Guillaume Delisle** - were cartographers. **Minhaj-i-sira**j - used the term India to mean dominions of Delhi Sultanate, not including south India. Hindustan was used by Babur to describe geography, flora and fauna of the subcontinent. Paper was more easily available from **14th century onwards**. Miniature paintings were used to illustrate the text of paintings. **Taliq, nastaliq and shikaste** - are Persian and Arabic writing styles. By 700 AD, many regions already possessed distinct geographical dimensions and their own language and cultural characteristics.
        2. Brahmins position was consolidated by **new rulers searching for prestige**. Idea of bhakti – of a loving, personal deity that devotees could reach without the aid of priests or elaborate rituals. Like Hinduism, Islam was interpreted in a variety of ways - Shias (Prophet's son-in-law Ali is the leader) and Sunnis (accepted leadership of father-in-law Bakr). Sunnis are the largest religious domination, followed by Catholics. Sunni schools, prominent 4- **Hanafi (reason), Shafi'i**, Maliki and Hanbali.
    2. New kingdoms
        
        1. Samantas - **big landlords/warrior chief** who were subordinate to the kings. Called themselves mahasamanta or maha-mandaleswara. **Rashtrakutas** (Dantidurga performed hiranya-garbha ritual to "rebirth" himself as a kshatriya) gained power by overthrowing their Chalukyan overlord. Brahmanas also **took up arms** and established kingdoms (Gurjaras and Kadambas).
        2. Administration: resources were obtained from producers - peasants, cattle-keepers, artisans. Cholas took taxes - **vetti** (forced labor) & **kadamai** (land revenue). Prashasti contain details that may not be true. Copper plates with royal seal - record of grant of land by the ruler. Kalhana wrote Rajatarangini which was an account of Kashmir.
        3. **Kannauj** - was center of conquest for subcontinent rulers. Foreign invaders raided the temples for their wealth. **Kitab-ul-Hind written by Al-Biruni** is an account of subcontinent around that period (11th century).
        4. **Cholas** - founder Vijayalaya, seized power from Pandyan and Pallavas territories. Rajaraja consolidated power, **Rajendra I raided Sri Lanka and SE Asia by building navies** for these expedition. Great Living Chola temples - UNESCO World Heritage Site consists of 3 Shiva temples - Brihadeeswarar, Gangaikonda Cholapuram (Rajendra I), Airavatesvara. Temples hub of economic, social and cultural life. Chola **bronze image are the finest** in the world. From 5-6th century, Kaveri delta opened up for large scale cultivation.
        5. Admin of cholas - **ur was settlement of peasants**. Group of villages formed unit called nadus. Nadus dispensed justice and collected taxes. **Vellala** caste was dominant. Rich landowners were given titles by kings like - muvendavelan (peasant serving 3 kings), araiyar and gave them important offices in the State. Types of land - **vellanvagai** (non-Brahaman), **brahmadeya** (gift to Brahamanas), **Shalabhoga** (for maintenance of schools), **Devadana** (temples), **pallichchhandam** (Jainas institutions). Brahmadeya was looked after by a sabha who recorded decisions on the walls of the temples. **Uttaramerur inscription** - members of sabha should own the land, 35-70 age, knowledge of vedas, account of himself and relatives, honest, 3 year max term. Association of traders (nagaram) performed admin functions. Periyapuranam (12th century Tamil work) talks about **outcastes** called **Pulaiyas**.
    3. Delhi Sultanate
        
        1. Delhi became an important commercial center under **Tomaras and Chahamanas.** Coins minted called **delhiwal**.
        2. |   |   |   |
            |---|---|---|
            |**Rajput**|**Early 12th century - 1206**||
            |Mamluk Dynasty|1206-1290|Turks|
            |Khilji Dynasty|1290-1320|Turks|
            |Tughlaq Dynasty|1320-1414|Turko-Indian|
            |Sayyid Dynasty|1414-1451|Turks|
            |Lodi Dynasty|1451-1526|Pashtuns/Afghans|
            
        3. **Tarikh/tawarikh -** are histories written in Persian the language of administration of Delhi Sultans. The authors of these had lived in cities and not villages, expected reward from the rulers, advised to **preserve ideal social order** based on birth right and gender distinctions. **Raziyya Sultan** was the only woman ruler of Delhi Sultanate. Minaj-i-sayyid was her chronicler. Usually women ruler kept their gender identity on low profile (**Rudramadevi, Didda**). Delhi Sultanate was one of the few states in the world which could repel Mongol invasion.
        4. Expansion of Delhi Sultanate - 1st expansion in internal frontiers - hinterland around garrison towns was controlled by clearing forests and **encouraging agriculture**. 2nd expansion - external frontiers - military expedition into Southern India. Notable - **Alauddin Khilji & Muhammad Tughlaq**. Quwwat al-Islam (Qutab complex) - built in 12th century by **Qutbuddin Aybak and Iltutmish**. Qibla is direction of Kabba in Mecca.
        5. Administration - **Bandagan** (special slave for military slaves) were governors. Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to their heirs. New Sultans had their own servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility. The patronage of these humble people by the Delhi Sultans also shocked many elites and the authors of Persian tawarikh criticized the Delhi Sultans for appointing the “low and base-born” to high offices. #important
        6. Khilji and Tughlaq - appointed **muqtis or iqtadars**, who were basically **feudal lords.** This position was **not hereditary** and the muqtis were frequently transferred. Accountants kept a check on amount of revenue collected. Rights of chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were also forced to pay taxes. 3 types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called kharaj about 50% of peasant’s produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses. But entire area was not under effective administrations - forests or far away provinces or South India. **Tribal chieftains defended** themselves (protected by bamboo forests and harvested rainwater for crops and selves) - account by Ibn Battuta.
        7. Mongols - attacked under Genghis Khan. Mongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the reign of **Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq’s rule**. Forced both to mobilize a large standing army in Delhi which posed a huge administrative challenge. Strategies - #important
        8. |   |   |
            |---|---|
            |Alauddin Khilji|Muhammad bin Tughlaq|
            |**Defensive** measures, raised large standing army|Raised a large standing army to **attack** Transoxiana, emptied Delhi-i-kunha and forced migration to Daulatabad|
            |Taxed land between Ganga and Yamuna at 50% to feed his soldiers|Produce from same area was collected as tax, but levied **additional** taxes, which coincided with **famine**|
            |Paid **cash than iqtas** (rations), and **controlled** prices of goods in Delhi and surveyed by officers|Paid cash but instead of controlling prices gave out tokens (think sodexo), which people didn't trust. They instead paid taxes with it which could also be counterfeited.|
            |Measures were considered successful, reign was marked by cheap prices and efficient supply of goods and services|Measures considered as a **failure**. Offensive campaign was a disaster and his administrative measures created problems. Resented for emptying cities, famines, **"token" currency**|
            
        
        To Tughlaq's credit - **planned an offensive** against Mongols and capture their territory.
        
    4. Mughals
        
        1. Mughals were descendants of 2 lineages - **Genghis Khan** (mother's side, ruler of Central Asia) & **Timur** (father's side, ruler of Iran Iraq Turkey).
            
            1. Babur - 1526-1530. Defeated Ibrahim Lodi at **1st Battle of Panipat in 1526** establishing Mughal empire in Northern India. 1528 defeated Rajputs at Chanderi.
            2. Humayun - 1530-1540 & 1555-56 - divided inheritance as per will of father. Sher Khan Suri ruled for 15 years after defeating Humayun at Chausa & Kanauj. Humayun re-captures Delhi with the help of Safavid Shah of Iran
            3. Akbar 1556-1605 - regent king under Bairam Khan until 1570. Consolidated power by launching campaigns against neighboring kingdoms such as Malwa, Gondwana, Sisodiya etc. 1570-1585 - Gujarat, Bihar, Bengal, Odisha captured. 1585-1605 - Kabul, Kandahar + Deccan.
            4. Jahangir 1605 - 1627 - Military campaigns continue. Shah Jahan takes over after his death.
            5. Shah Jahan 1627 - 1658 - Taj Mahal and Shahjahanabad.
            6. Aurangzeb 1658 - 1707 - killed his 2 brothers over succession conflict and jailed Shah Jahan for life in Agra.
        2. Mughals followed **coparcenary inheritance** **(joint heirship**) instead of primogeniture - which ultimately led to **battle of succession** among princes. The careful balance between **defeating but not humiliating** their opponents enabled the Mughals to extend their influence over many kings and chieftains. _Mansabdars_ refers to a person who holds **mansab** meaning a rank. It was a **grading system** used by Mughals to fix rank, salary and military responsibilities (maintain cavalrymen); which was determined by a **numerical value called zat**. Mansabdars received their salaries as revenue assignments called **jagir**.
            
            1. Peasantry by Aurangzeb's reign suffered because mansabdars increased while jagirs were in short supply. Revenue from jagirs was **extracted** as much as possible.
            2. **Zabti** was a revenue system under Akbar's reign by **Todar Mal**. After careful survey tax was fixed on each crop in cash based on 10 year data. Each province was divided into revenue circle with its own schedule of revenue rates for individual crops. Not possible in Gujarat and Bengal but where Mughals had direct control. #important
            3. **Abul Fazl wrote Akbar Nama**, 3 volume history of Akbar's reign. **Ain-i-Akbari is 3rd volume of it** and deals with his administration, army, household et al and provides rich details about traditions and culture of people living in India.
        3. Akbar's policies - Empire was divided into **provinces called subas**, governed by **subadar**. Financial officer called **diwan**. Peace and order controlled by officials such as the military paymaster (**bakhshi**), the minister in charge of **religious and charitable patronage (sadr)**, military commanders (**faujdars**) and the town police commander (**kotwal**).
        4. Sulh-i-kul (universal peace) - This idea of **tolerance** did not discriminate between people of different religions in his realm, focused on a **system of ethics** – honesty, justice, peace – that was universally applicable. Was adopted by Akbar not merely for religious purposes, but as a part of general imperial administrative policy. Akbar held **discussions** with priests of different religions in **ibadat khana.**
        5. Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure **benefited the artisans and peasantry** who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers – the peasant and the artisan.
            
            1. Poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources – tools and supplies – to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world
        6. Ottoman Turkey - Sultan Suleiman. He was the great emperor of Ottoman empire, known as al-Qanuni (law giver) because of large number of qanuns passed during his reign.
    5. Rulers and buildings
        
        1. Qutb Minar is **5 storeys tall**, 1st floor was by **Qutbuddin Aybak and rest by Iltutmish**. Tallest brick minaret in the world. Engineering skills - corbelled or trabeate technique, used between 8-13 AD. From early 12 AD - (1) The weight of the superstructure above the doors and windows was sometimes carried by arches. This architectural form was called “**arcuate**” (2) **Limestone cement** was increasingly used in construction, which made construction of large structures **easier and faster**
        2. Temple construction in early 11 AD -
            
            1. Kandariya Mahadeva - **Shiva** temple by King **Dhangadeva of Chandela** dynasty. Khajuraho had royal temples where **commoners weren't allowed.** Main hall (mahamandapa) & main shrine (garbhagriha).
            2. Rajarajeshwara temple - Shiva temple by King **Rajaraja** deva which doesn’t allow non-Hindus. Had tallest shikhara of its time.
        3. As each new dynasty came to power, kings wanted to emphasize **their moral right** to be rulers. Constructing places of worship provided rulers with the chance to proclaim their close relationship with God, especially important in an age of rapid political change. Because kings built temples to demonstrate their devotion to God and their power and wealth, it is not surprising that when they attacked one another’s kingdoms they often targeted these buildings
        4. Mughals were especially interested in literature, art and architecture (chahar baghs). The **central towering dome and the tall gateway** (**pishtaq**) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun’s tomb. During Shah Jahan’s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas or aam) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as **chihil sutun** or **forty-pillared halls.** //The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by architectural features, such as facing Mecca when court is in session. #important
        5. Shah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal. The mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Access to river was reserved for imperial king.
        6. The creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilization of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a **thatched hut.** Mughals liked this “**Bangla dome**” so much that they used it in their architecture. The impact of other regions was also evident. In Akbar’s capital at Fatehpur Sikri many of the buildings show the influence of the **architectural styles of Gujarat and Malwa.**
    6. Towns, traders, craftsmen
        
        1. **Sthapatis** (sculptors). Thanjavur is an example of a temple town. Temple towns represent a very important pattern of urbanization, the process by which cities develop. Towns emerged around temples such as those of Bhillasvamin (Bhilsa or **Vidisha** in Madhya Pradesh), and Somnath in Gujarat. Other important temple towns included Kanchipuram and Madurai in Tamil Nadu, and Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh.
        2. Banjaras were traders. Guilds formed to protect interests as traders traveled intensively - **Manigramam and Nanadesi**. These guilds traded extensively both within the peninsula and with Southeast Asia and China.
        3. Crafts - The craftsperson of Bidar were so famed for their **inlay work** in copper and silver that it came to be called **Bidri**. **Panchalas or Vishwakarma** community, consisting of goldsmiths, bronze smiths, blacksmiths, masons and carpenters, were essential to the building of temples. Weavers were the **Saliyar or Kaikkolars**.
        4. Hampi is located in the Krishna-Tungabhadra basin, which formed the nucleus of the Vijayanagara Empire, founded in 1336. The magnificent ruins at Hampi reveal a well-fortified city. **No mortar or cementing agent** was used in the construction of these walls and the technique followed was to wedge them together by interlocking.
        5. Surat in Gujarat was the emporium of western trade during the Mughal period along with Cambay (present day Khambat) and somewhat later, Ahmedabad. Surat was the gateway for trade with West Asia via the Gulf of Ormuz. Surat has also been called the gate to Mecca because many pilgrim ships set sail from here. Surat hundis were honored in the far-off markets of Cairo in Egypt, Basra in Iraq and Antwerp in Belgium.
        6. Both the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to **control Masulipatnam** as it became the most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch.
        7. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European countries were **searching for spices and textiles.** The English, Dutch and French formed East India Companies in order to expand their commercial activities in the east. Initially great Indian traders like **Mulla Abdul Ghafur and Virji Vora** who owned a large number of ships competed with them. However, the European Companies used their naval power to gain control of the sea trade and forced Indian traders to work as their agents.
        8. 18th century saw the rise of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, which are nodal cities today. Crafts and commerce underwent major changes as merchants and artisans (such as weavers) were moved into the Black Towns established by the European companies within these new cities. The “blacks” or native traders and crafts persons were confined here while the “white” rulers occupied the superior residencies of Fort St. George in Madras or Fort St. William in Calcutta.
    7. Tribes, Nomads & Settled Communities
        
        1. Difference between the **high and low**, and between the rich and poor, increased. Under the Delhi Sultans and the Mughals, this hierarchy between social classes grew further. Many societies in the subcontinent did not follow the social rules and rituals prescribed by the Brahmanas. Nor were they divided into numerous unequal classes. Such societies are **often called tribes.** Preserved rich customs and oral traditions were passed down to each new generation. Present day historians have started using such oral traditions to write tribal histories.
        2. Banjaras were the most important trader-nomads. Their caravan was called **tanda**. Many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of **jatis**. Smiths, carpenters and masons – were also recognized as separate jatis. Jatis, rather than varna, became the basis for organizing society. The rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set an example for the tribal people to follow. Many **dominant tribes** of Punjab, Sind and the NW Frontier adopted Islam quite early. The **unequal social order**, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was not widely accepted in these areas.
        3. Gonds lived in a vast forested region called Gondwana – or “country inhabited by Gonds” and shifting cultivation. Large Gond tribe was divided into many smaller clans, each clan with own raja or rai. About the time that the power of the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond kingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller Gond chiefs. Gond kingdom of **Garha Katanga that had 70,000 villages.**
            
            1. Kingdom divided into garhs. Each garh was controlled by a particular Gond clan. This was further divided into units of 84 villages called **chaurasi**. The chaurasi was subdivided into **barhots** which were made up of 12 villages each. Was also involved in exporting elephants.
            2. later struggled unsuccessfully against the stronger Bundelas and Marathas.
        4. **Ahoms** migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from present-day Myanmar in the 13th century. They created a new state by **suppressing** the older political system of the **bhuiyans** (landlords). Ahom state depended upon forced labor. Those forced to work for the state were called **paiks**. A census of the population was taken. Each village had to send a number of paiks by rotation.
            
            1. Ahom society was divided into **clans or khels.** There were very few castes of artisans, so **artisans in the Ahom areas came from the adjoining** kingdoms. A khel often controlled several villages. The peasant was given land by his village community. **Even the king could not take it away without the community’s consent.**
            2. Transformed into a Hindu society in early 18th century as kings sought prestige and were encouraged in performing rituals. Poets and scholars were given land grants. Theatre was encouraged. Important works of Sanskrit were translated into the local language. Historical works, known as **buranjis**, were also written – first in the Ahom language and then in Assamese.
        5. Varna-based society and tribal people constantly interacted with each other. This interaction caused both kinds of societies to adapt and change. There were many different tribes and they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of time, many of them merged with caste based society. Others, however, rejected both the caste system and orthodox Hinduism.
    8. Devotional Paths to Divine
        
        1. Before large kingdoms emerged, different groups of people worshipped their own gods and goddesses. As people were brought together, new ideas began to develop. All living things pass through countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good deeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly, the idea that all human beings are **not equal even at birth gained** ground during this period. The belief that social privileges came from birth in a “noble” family or a “high” caste was the subject of many learned texts.
        2. Many people were uneasy with such ideas and turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jains according to which it was **possible to overcome social differences** and break the cycle of rebirth through personal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a Supreme God who could deliver humans from such bondage if **approached with devotion (or bhakti)**. This idea, **advocated in the Bhagavadgita, grew in popularity** in the early centuries of the Common Era.
        3. 7th to 9th centuries saw the emergence of new religious movements, led by the **Nayanars (saints devoted to Shiva) and Alvars (saints devoted to Vishnu)** who came from all castes including those considered “untouchable” like the **Pulaiyar and the Panars**.
            
            1. 63 Nayanars, who belonged to different caste backgrounds. Best known were **Appar, Sambandar, Sundarar and Manikkavasagar**. There are two sets of compilations of their songs – _Tevaram and Tiruvacakam_
            2. There were 12 Alvars, who came from equally divergent backgrounds, the best known being **Periyalvar**, his daughter **Andal, Tondaradippodi Alvar and Nammalvar**. Their songs were compiled in the _Divya Prabandham_.
        4. **Shankara** - born in 8th century Kerala - advocate of **Advaita** or the doctrine of the oneness of the individual soul and the Supreme God which is the Ultimate Reality. **Ramanuja**, born in Tamil Nadu in the 11th century, was deeply influenced by the Alvars (Vaishnavites). He propounded the doctrine of **Vishisht advaita** or qualified oneness in that the soul even when united with the Supreme God remained distinct (non-dualistic).
            
            1. Vedanta is an umbrella term for many sub-traditions, ranging from **dualism to non-dualism**, all of which developed on the basis of a common textual connection called the **Prasthanatrayi**.
            2. Prasthanatrayi is a collective term for the **Principal Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita**. Some of the better known sub-traditions of Vedanta include Advaita (non-dualism), Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism), and Dvaita (dualism).
        5. **Virashaiva** movement initiated by **Basavanna** and his companions like **Allama Prabhu and Akkamahadevi**. This movement began in Karnataka in the mid-12th century.
            
            1. Virashaivas argued strongly for the **equality** of all human beings and against Brahmanical ideas about caste and the treatment of women. They were also **against** all forms of ritual and idol worship.
            2. Basavanna spread social awareness through his poetry known as **Vachanaas**.  introduced new public institutions such as the **Anubhava Mantapa** (or, the “hall of spiritual experience”), which welcomed men and women from all socio-economic backgrounds to discuss spiritual and mundane questions of life, in open.
        6. From the 13th to the 17th centuries Maharashtra saw a great number of saint-poets, whose songs in simple Marathi continue to inspire people. The most important among them were **Jnaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram** as well as women like **Sakhubai** and the family of **Chokhamela**, who belonged to the “untouchable” Mahar caste. This regional tradition of bhakti focused on the Vitthala (a form of Vishnu) temple in Pandharpur, as well as on the notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of all people. //**abhang** (Marathi devotional hymn for Vithoba) #important
        7. **Nathpanthis, Siddhacharas and Yogis** criticized the ritual and other aspects of conventional religion and the social order, using simple, logical arguments. They advocated renunciation of the world.
            
            1. Nathpanthis - Shaivism sub-tradition within Hinduism. A medieval era movement, it combined ideas from Buddhism, Shaivism and Yoga traditions in India.
            2. Siddhacharas - devotional group popular among the lower caste people as they did not advocate rituals but called for renouncing worldly rituals
            3. Yogis - also referred to members of the Nath siddha tradition of Hinduism
        8. Sufism - The sants had much in common with the Sufis, so much so that it is believed that they adopted many ideas of each other. **Sufis were Muslim mystics**. They rejected outward religiosity and emphasized love and devotion to God and compassion towards all fellow human beings. The Sufis often rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behavior demanded by Muslim religious scholars. Among the great Sufis of Central Asia were **Ghazzali, Rumi and Sadi.** Like the Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis, the Sufis too believed that the heart can be trained to look at the world in a different way.
            
            1. They developed elaborate methods of training using **zikr** (chanting of a name or sacred formula), contemplation, **sama** (singing), **raqs** (dancing), discussion of parables, breath control, etc. under the guidance of a **master or pir**. Thus emerged the **silsilas**, a **spiritual genealogy of Sufi teachers**, each following a slightly different method (tariqa) of instruction and ritual practice.
            2. The **Chishti silsila** was among the most influential orders. It had a long line of teachers like Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki of Delhi, Baba Farid of Punjab, Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi and Bandanawaz Gisudaraz of Gulbarga.
        9. Period **after 13th century saw a new wave** of the bhakti movement in north India. This was an age when Islam, Brahmanical Hinduism, Sufism, various strands of bhakti, and the Nathpanths, Siddhas and Yogis influenced one another. Some of them like **Kabir and Baba Guru Nanak rejected all orthodox religions.** ￼Others like Tulsidas and Surdas **accepted existing beliefs** and practices but wanted to make these accessible to all. Tulsidas conceived of God in the **form of Rama**. Tulsidas’s composition, the **Ramcharitmanas**, written in Awadhi. ￼Surdas was an ardent devotee of Krishna. His compositions are in _Sursagara, Surasaravali_ and **Sahitya Lahari.**
        10. ![C. C. K 1 C · C. C•Tukrvn C. SEA C. 1 C. ](Exported%20image%2020250424103622-1.tiff)
        11. This tradition also included saints like **Dadu Dayal, Ravidas and Mirabai.** Mirabai was a Rajput princess married into the royal family of Mewar in the sixteenth century. Mirabai became a disciple of **Ravidas** (contested), a saint from a caste considered “untouchable”; devoted to Krishna and composed innumerable bhajans. Her songs openly challenged the norms of the “upper” castes and became popular with the masses in Rajasthan and Gujarat.
        12. **Kabir**, who probably lived in the 15-16th centuries, was one of the most influential saints. He was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or weavers settled in or near the city of Benares.
            
            1. His ideas are from collection of verses called **sakhis and pads**, said to have been composed by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some of these were preserved in the **Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani** (text of the Dadupanthi tradition within Hinduism) and **Bijak** (Kabirpanthi's text).
            2. Kabir’s teachings were based on a **complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions**. His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system. The language of his poetry was a form of spoken Hindi.
            3. Kabir believed in a **formless Supreme God** and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from among both Hindus and Muslims.
        13. Baba Guru Nanak (1469-1539) born at Talwandi (Nankana Sahib in Pakistan), he travelled widely before establishing a center at Kartarpur (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi). A regular worship that consisted of the singing of his own hymns was established there for his followers. Irrespective of their former creed, caste or gender, his followers ate together in the common kitchen (langar). The sacred space thus created by Baba Guru Nanak was known as **dharmsal**. It is now known as **Gurdwara**.
            
            1. Guru Angad (his successor) compiled the compositions of Baba Guru Nanak, to which he added his own in a new script known as **Gurmukhi**. The three successors of Guru Angad also wrote under the name of “Nanak”. The fifth guru, **Guru Arjun Dev**, gave the Sikhs three things. The first was in the shape of the **Adi Granth**, which contains the sayings of five gurus and other allied saints. The second was the standardized script for **Gurmukhi in which the Adi Granth was first written**. And finally, the site and the foundation of the **Har Mandir sahib** or the Golden Temple and the Akal Takht at Amritsar, the highest seat from where the dictats for the entire Sikh community are issued. #important
            2. To this compilation were added the writings of other figures like **Shaikh Farid, Sant Kabir, Bhagat Namdev and Guru Tegh Bahadur.** In 1706 this compilation was authenticated by Guru Tegh Bahadur’s son and successor, **Guru Gobind Singh**. It is now known as Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of the Sikhs. The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh created the Khalsa, which means “the pure”, in 1699. He also ordained the Sikhs to take **five vows**, namely, keeping of kesh (long hair and a beard), kangha (comb), kada (a metallic bangle), kirpan (a sword) and kaccha (an underwear extending to a little above the knees). Consequently, these symbols became the distinguishing marks of a Sikh. He further added that after his death the **Adi Granth will be the guru of the Sikhs** and they have to pay obeisance to this holy book.
            3. Nanak emphasized the importance of the worship of one God. He insisted that caste, creed or gender was irrelevant for attaining liberation. His idea of liberation was **not that of a state of inert bliss** but rather the pursuit of active life with a strong sense of social commitment. He himself used the terms nam, dan and insan for the essence of his teaching, which actually meant right worship, welfare of others and purity of conduct. His teachings are now remembered as **nam-japna, kirt-karna and vandchhakna (sharing)**, which also underline the importance of right belief and worship, honest living, and helping others. Thus, Baba Guru Nanak’s idea of **equality had social and political implications.** This might partly explain the difference between the history of the followers of Baba Guru Nanak and the history of the followers of the other religious figures of the medieval centuries, like Kabir, Ravidas and Dadu whose ideas were very similar to those of Baba Guru Nanak.
    9. Regional Culture
        
        1. Cheras -> development of **Malayalam in Mahodayapuram** (their capital). Added Sanskrit traditions to it. Regional texts are indebted to Sanskrit. **Manipravalam** - mix of Sanskrit and Tamil - one work is **Lilatilakam** dealing in grammar and poetics. #important
        2. Regional cultures grew around religious traditions. Best example - is the cult of **Jagannatha** (lord of the world, name for Vishnu) at Puri. To date, the local tribal people make the wooden image of the deity, which suggests that the deity was originally a local god, later identified with Vishnu. **Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman,** decided to erect a temple for **Purushottama Jagannatha** at Puri. ￼Rajputs had a tradition of heroism, often choosing death over defeat.
        3. Kathak - The term kathak is derived from katha, a word used in Sanskrit and other languages for story. The kathaks were originally a **caste of story-tellers** in temples of north India, who embellished their performances with gestures and songs. Kathak began evolving into a **distinct mode of dance** in the 15th and 16th centuries with the spread of the bhakti movement. The legends of **Radha-Krishna** were enacted in folk plays called rasa lila, which combined folk dance with the basic gestures of the kathak story-tellers.
            
            1. Under the Mughal emperors, Kathak was performed in the court, where it acquired its present features and developed into a form of dance with a distinctive style. Subsequently, it developed in two traditions or gharanas: one in the courts of Jaipur and the other in Lucknow. Under the patronage of **Wajid Ali Shah**, the last Nawab of Awadh, it grew into a major art form.
            2. Kathak, like several other cultural practices, was viewed with **disfavor** by most British administrators. However, it survived and continued to be performed by courtesans, and was recognized as one of six “classical” forms of dance in the country after independence.
            3. Other dance forms that are recognized as classical at present are: **Bharatanatyam** (Tamil Nadu) **Kathakali** (Kerala) **Odissi** (Orissa) **Kuchipudi** (Andhra Pradesh) **Manipuri** (Manipur)
        4. Miniature paintings - Miniatures are small-sized paintings, generally done in **water color** on cloth or paper; were patronized by Mughal emperors. After decline of Mughal emperors, the artists moved to emerging regional kingdoms. As a result, Mughal artistic tastes influenced the regional courts of the Deccan and the Rajput courts of Rajasthan. Himachal Pradesh developed a bold and intense style of miniature painting called **Basohli**. The most popular text to be painted here was **Bhanudatta’s Rasamanjari**; led to the founding of the Kangra school of painting (soft colors including cool blues and greens, and a lyrical treatment of themes)
        5. Although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it passed through several stages of evolution. Also, a **wide range of non-Sanskrit word**s, derived from a variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, and European languages, have become **part of modern Bengali**. Early Bengal literature - Sanskrit and independent of it. Sanksrit - Mangalkavya (**dealing with local deities)** and bhakti literature (biography of Chaitanyadeva). Independent - **Nath literature** such as the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy tales, folk tales and ballads.
            
            1. **Pirs** - were **community leaders i**ncluding saints or Sufis and other religious personalities, daring colonizers and deified soldiers, various Hindu and Buddhist deities and even animistic spirits. The cult of pirs became very popular and their shrines can be found everywhere in Bengal.
            2. Temples were built by people to demonstrate power and proclaim their deity. Coming of Europeans created new economic opportunities and Bengal went on a temple building spree (15th-19th century)
            3. When local deities, once worshipped in thatched huts in villages, gained the recognition of the Brahmanas, their images began to be housed in temples. The temples began to copy the double-roofed (**dochala**) or four-roofed (**chauchala**) structure of the thatched huts. This led to the evolution of **Bengali style temple architecture.**
            4. Brihaddharma Purana, a 13th-century Sanskrit text from Bengal, permitted the local Brahmanas to eat certain varieties of fish.
    10. 18th century political formations
        
        1. Decline of Mughals - Mughal Empire reached the height of its success and started facing a variety of crises towards the closing years of the 17th century. Aurangzeb had depleted the military and financial resources of his empire by fighting a long war in the Deccan. Under his successors, the efficiency of the imperial administration broke down. It became increasingly difficult for the later Mughal emperors to keep a check on their powerful mansabdars. **Nobles appointed as governors (subadars) often controlled the offices** of revenue and military administration (diwani and faujdari) making them **all powerful**.
        2. Peasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of northern and western India added to these problems. These revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures of mounting taxes. At other times they were attempts by powerful chieftains to consolidate their own positions.
        3. In the midst of this economic and political crisis, the ruler of Iran, **Nadir Shah,** sacked and plundered the city of Delhi in 1739 and took away immense amounts of wealth. This invasion was followed by a series of plundering raids by the Afghan ruler **Ahmad Shah Abdali**, who invaded north India five times between 1748 and 1761.
        4. Farrukh Siyar (1713-1719) and Alamgir II (1754-1759) were assassinated, and two others Ahmad Shah (1748-1754) and Shah Alam II (1759-1816) were blinded by their nobles.
        5. New states - states of the eighteenth century can be divided into three overlapping groups: (1) States that were **old Mughal provinces** like Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad. Although extremely powerful and quite independent, the rulers of these states **did not break their formal ties** with the Mughal emperor. (2) States that had enjoyed considerable independence under the Mughals as **watan jagirs**. These included several Rajput principalities. (3) The last group included states under the control of Marathas, Sikhs and others like the Jats. These were of differing sizes and had seized their independence from the Mughals after a long-drawn armed struggle.
        6. Hyderabad - founder was **Asaf Jah**. Taking subsequent advantage of the turmoil in the Deccan and the competition amongst the court nobility, he gathered power in his hands and became the **actual ruler** of that region.
        7. Awadh - **Burhan-ul-mulk Saadat Khan** was subadar of Awadh and one of important states to emerge after Mughal break up. He held the combined offices of subadari, diwani and faujdari. It sold the right to collect tax to the highest bidders. These **“revenue farmers” (****ijaradars****)** agreed to pay the state a fixed sum of money. Local bankers guaranteed the payment of this contracted amount to the state. In turn, the revenue-farmers were given considerable freedom in the assessment and collection of taxes.
        8. Bengal - Bengal gradually broke away from Mughal control under **Murshid Quli Khan** who was appointed as the naib, deputy to the governor of the province. Although **never a formal subada****r, Murshid Quli Khan** very quickly seized all the power that went with that office.
        9. 3 common features amongst these states - (1) Erstwhile Mughal nobles were highly suspicious of some of the administrative systems that they had inherited, in particular the **jagirdari** system. (2) their method of tax collection **differed**. Rather than relying upon the officers of the state, all three regimes contracted with **revenue-farmers for the collection of revenue**. The practice of **ijaradari**, thoroughly disapproved of by the Mughals, spread all over India in the 18th century. Their impact on the countryside differed considerably (3) Emerging relationship with rich bankers and merchants. These people lent money to revenue farmers, received land as security and collected taxes from these lands through their own agents. Throughout India the richest merchants and bankers were gaining a stake in the new political order. #important
        10. Sikhs - Organization of the Sikhs into a political community during the 17th century helped in **regional state-building** in the Punjab. Several battles were fought by Guru Gobind Singh against the Rajput and Mughal rulers, both before and after the institution of the Khalsa in 1699. After his death in 1708, the Khalsa **rose in revolt** against the Mughal authority under **Banda Bahadur**’s leadership, declared their sovereign rule by striking coins in the name of Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh, and established their own administration between the Sutlej and the Jamuna. Sikh territories in the late 18th century extended from the Indus to the Jamuna but they were divided under different rulers. One of them, **Maharaja Ranjit Singh**, reunited these groups and established his **capital at Lahore in 1799.**
        11. Marathas - Shivaji (1627-1680) carved out a stable kingdom with the support of powerful warrior families (**deshmukhs**). Groups of highly mobile, peasant pastoralists (**kunbis**) provided the backbone of the Maratha army. Shivaji used these forces to challenge the Mughals in the peninsula. Between 1720 and 1761, the Maratha empire expanded, chipping away at the authority of the Mughal Empire. Malwa and Gujarat were seized from the Mughals by the 1720s; Maratha king possessed the right to levy chauth (25%) and sardeshmukhi (10%) in the entire region
        12. Jats - The Jats were **prosperous agriculturists**, and towns like Panipat and Ballabhgarh became important trading centers in the areas dominated by them. Under Suraj Mal the kingdom of Bharatpur emerged as a strong state.
3. Class 8 Part 1
    
    1. Beginnings
        
        1. **James Mill** wrote A History of British India and divided Indian history into - Hindu, Muslim and British.
        2. 1st English factory set up on Hugli near **Kalikata in 1651, fortified it by 1696**. First got a **farman** for right to free trade from **Aurangzeb**. Successive nawabs of Bengal accused Company of deceit while Company declared that unjust demands of local officials was ruining trade. Battle of Plassey was fought in 1757 between **Clive and Sirajuddaulah**, resulting in defeat of latter as forces led by Mir Jafar never fought the battle. Eventually after failing to work with puppet Nawabs, they decide to rule directly themselves.
        3. **In 1765, Diwani was allowed**. This stopped flow of gold from Britain as revenues from Diwani was used to finance trade, wars and fortification. Company **rarely** launched a direct military attack on unknown territory, rather choosing political, economic and diplomatic methods to annex a kingdom. After **Battle of Buxar**, company started **appointing residents** in Indian states.
        4. Mysore - Four wars with Mysore, eventually **winning in 1799 with death of Tipu**.
        5. Marathas - subdued in a series of wars. First war ended with **Treaty of Salbai** in 1782. 2nd war 1803-05 resulted in British gaining territories. **3rd war 1817-19 crushed Marathas.**
        6. **Policy of paramountcy initiated under Lord Hastings** - in order to protect its interests, annexing or threatening to do so to any Indian kingdom was justified. Due to fear of a Russian invasion, EIC sought to secure north-west, hence war with Afghanistan bw 1838-42 and established indirect rule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. **Punjab in 1849** after couple of wars after Maharaja Ranjit Singh's death. #important
        7. **Doctrine of Lapse - Lord Dalhousie** devised this policy, if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would lapse. Kingdoms annexed under this doctrine - **Satara, Sambalpur, Udaipur, Nagpur, Jhansi.**
        8. Setting up of administration - 1st Governor-General introduced several administrative reforms, notably in sphere of justice. From 1772, new system of justice was established - **faujdari adalat (criminal) and diwani adalat (civil)**. Criminal courts under **qazi and mufti** but supervision of collector. In 1775, digest of Hindu laws were compiled for benefit of European judges. **N. B. Halhed translated this to English.**
        9. Company army - focused on building professional soldiers armed with new technology. Infantry regiments were more important than sawars.
    2. Ruling the countryside
        
        1. Revenue for the Company - even after becoming Diwan, **company saw itself as a trader**. Effort was to buy cotton and silk as cheaply as possible and increase revenue as much as it could. Bengal economy was precarious at this point, and in **1770 famine wiped out 1/3 population or 10 million people.**
        2. After two decades of debate on question of agriculture improvement, **Permanent Settlement** was introduced in 1793 by Lord Cornwallis. Rajas and taluqdars were **recognized as zamindars**. Amount to be paid was fixed permanently, and zamindar to invest in land to increase production, thereby, own profits.
            
            1. However, revenue fixed was so high that zamindars struggled to pay. They **preferred renting** it to tenants and not interested in improving the land. Conversely, cultivators found system extremely oppressive. Rent was high and rights insecure.
            2. Declared Zamindars as the **owners** of the land. Hence, they could keep **1/11th of the revenue** collected to themselves while the British got a fixed share of 10/11th of the revenue collected. Zamindars were **free** to fix the rents.
        3. **Mahalwari** - Holt **Mackenzie** devised it in Bengal presidency. Estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added to calculate revenue that each **mahal** (village/group of village) had to pay. Demand revised periodically. Charge of collection given to **village headman**.
        4. **Ryotwari** - developed in Madras presidency. By **Alexander Read and Thomas Munro**. Settlement directly made with cultivators (ryots).Fields carefully surveyed before revenue assessment made
            
            1. Revenue officials fixed too high a demand, peasants unable to pay, **ryots fled the countryside and villages became deserted.**
        5. Crops for Europe - by late 18th century, company was trying its best to expand cultivation of opium and indigo. Indigo primarily grows in tropics and produced rich blue color. Europeans were using plant called **woad** to make violet and blue dyes, manufacturers of which tried to get indigo banned. However, indigo plantations came up in different parts of the colonized world. In late 18th century **due to slave rebellion** in **French** colonies, production of indigo fell by half. Bengal became **dominant exporter** of indigo to Britain.
            
            1. **Nij** - planter produced indigo in lands that **he directly controlled** (bought or rented). Indigo could only be cultivated in **fertile lands** and these were already occupied. It also required labor and ploughs and bullocks. Indigo season **coincided with rice** planting and harvesting. **Less than 25%** of land producing indigo was under this system.
            2. **Ryoti** - planters **forced ryots** to sing an agreement called **satta**. Those who signed get cash advances from planters at **low rate** of interest. Loan committed ryot to cultivating indigo on at least 25% of area under his holding. Planter provided seed and drill. The system was **harsh** as price they got for indigo was low and cycle of loan never ended.
            3. Indigo production - plant was taken to vats (fermenting or storage vessel), 3-4 vats with each having a separate function.
        6. **Blue rebellion** - in 1859, ryots in Bengal **refused to grow indigo,** socially boycotted planters and attacked **gomasthas** (agents of planters). They felt that had support of local zamindars and headmen against planters. They were unhappy with increasing power of planters. Ashley Eden, a magistrate, tried to control the situation which was read as support for rebellion. Worried about this, govt brought military to protect planters and set up **Indigo Commission**. It held planters guilty and asked ryots to fulfil existing contracts.
    3. Tribals & dikus (outsiders)
        
        1. Most tribal societies had customs and rituals which were very different from those laid down by Brahmanas. They were involved in variety of activities
            
            1. **Jhum cultivation** - shifting cultivation, slash and burn. Spread the ash from fire which contained potash to fertile the soil. **Broadcast the seeds** instead of ploughing. Field cultivated once was left fallow for a few years. Free movement in forests necessary.
            2. Hunter-gatherer - Forests essential for survival, dependent on forest produce. E.g. **Baigas**. But tribals were usually exploited in market and commercial activities. #important
            3. Herding and rearing - pastorals who moved according to seasons. E.g. **Van Gujjars, Lambadis, Gaddis, Bakarwals.**
            4. Settled cultivation - land belonged to whole clan, powerful men often rented out land instead of cultivating themselves.
        2. What changed under British rule
            
            1. Lost administrative power and **forced to follow law of British**, unable to fulfil their traditional functions
            2. British didn't want shifting cultivations as it affected revenue and harder to administer. Efforts to settle jhum cultivators was not successful.
            3. Forest laws were changed and **entire forests made state property.** Forest people not allowed to move freely and forced to move and find work. However, forest villages were established to **ensure supply of labor** in lieu of small patches of land to jhum cultivators. **Revolt of Songram Sangma 1906** in Assam was against colonial forest laws.
        3. Revolts - **Kols in 1832, Santhals in 1855, Bastar in 1910 and Warli in 1940**. ￼Birsa movement aimed to **drive out missionaries, moneylenders, landlords and govt, and set up a Munda raj** (restore the golden age when Mundas lived a good life). He was imprisoned for 2 years but came back and roused more support, his supporters attacking police stations and churches. Movement was significant in 2 ways - **forced colonial govt to introduce laws to protect their lands and tribal people's capacity to protest**
    4. First rebellion
        
        1. Nawabs lost their power gradually, and with that their authority and honor. Residents were stationed in their court, **armed forces disbanded** and revenues and territories overtaken. Awadh was one of the territories overtaken under subsidiary alliance **on charges of misgovernance**. In 1856, Canning decided that Bahadur Shah Zafar will be the last king, his descendants would be just princes.
        2. Peasants and sepoys - **high taxes and rigid collection** meant many failed to pay back loans on time and lost their lands. Sepoys were unhappy about pay, allowance, and violations to their religious beliefs (believed that one loses religion and caste if they cross the sea). Many Indians began to feel that British were destroying their religion, social customs and way of life - stopped practice of Sati, English language promoted, free pass to Christian missionaries and conversions made easier.
        3. 1857 rebellion - In May 1857, the immediate event which angered the sepoys was about the ammunition for the new rifles they had to use. The cartridges that were used in the rifles **had to be bitten open**. Hindus and Muslims were angry because they thought that the paper cartridges had **cow/pig fat** in them. Sepoys were dismissed from service and sentenced to jail. Other Indian soldiers marched to jail and released them, and attacked British officers. They marched to Delhi and asked BSZ to become leader of the rebellion **who agreed unwillingly.**
        4. Regiments after regiments mutinied and took off to join other troops. People of towns and villages **rallied around local leaders** who were ready to fight the British. Nana Saheb, adopted son of Peshwa Baji Rao, and Tantia Tope, Rani Lakshmibai, Rani Avantibai Lodhi were some other leaders of the mutiny. Many new leaders came up - Ahmadullah Shah Maulvi, Bakht Khan (soldier), Kunwar Singh (zamindar) were other key leaders.
        5. Suppression - Company brought **reinforcements** from England, passed **new laws** to convict rebels with ease and moved to storm the centers of revolt. Delhi was recaptured in Sep 1857, BSZ exiled to Burma. It took British two more years to defeat all other rebel leaders. British tried their **best to win back loyalty** of people by offering rewards to loyal landholders, land rights to rebels who haven't killed white people. However, many sepoys, rebels, nawabs were tried and hanged.
        6. Aftermath -
            
            1. British Parliament passed new Act in 1858 and transferred powers to British Crown to ensure more responsible management of Indian affairs. **Secretary of State for India** appointed and India Council to advise him. Viceroy (representative of the Crown) instead of Governor-General.
            2. All ruling chiefs assured that their territory will **not be annexed** in future, **doctrine of lapse abolished.** But acknowledge **Queen as sovereign** paramount.
            3. Increase number of British soldiers. **Gurkhas, Sikhs and Pathan** recruitment increased.
            4. Land and property of Muslims confiscated and treated with suspicion and hostility as British believed they were largely responsible for rebellion.
            5. British decided to respect customary religious and social practices of people in India.
    5. Delhi under British
        
        1. Cities such as **Surat, Machlipatnam and Seringapatam** were **de-urbanized** in 19th century as trade and commercial shifted as British took over.
        2. British gained **control of Delhi in 1803** after defeating Marathas. Since British India were ruling from Calcutta, Mughal emperor was allowed to continue living in Red Fort. Many refer to **1830-57 as period of Delhi renaissance.** After regaining the city from rebels, Delhi was plundered, area around Fort was cleared of gardens, pavilions and mosques. No worship was allowed in Jama Masjid for 5 years and 1/3 of city was demolished.
        3. New capital - In **1877**,Viceroy **Lytton org**anized a Durbar to acknowledge Queen as Empress of India. **1903 under Curzon**, durbar was held to celebrate the succession of Edward VII and Alexandra of Denmark as Emperor and Empress of India. In 1911, when King George V was crowned in England (Viceroy Hardinge), Durbar was held in Delhi (only time the sovereign attended) to celebrate and decision to shift capital to Delhi was announced. Annulment of the Partition of Bengal was also announced during this durbar.
        4. **Lutyens and Baker** designed New Delhi and its buildings. Overall look was **Classical Greek** with features borrowed from different period of India's imperial history. New Delhi was to represent a sense of law and order instead of chaotic old Delhi.
        5. During Partition - fierce rioting began. Over 2/3 of Delhi Muslims left. Delhi became a city of refugees. Lajpat Nagar and Tilak Nagar came up to house refugees. Large migration changed the social milieu of Delhi.
        6. Lahore Gate Improvement Scheme - Robert Clarke in 1888 for walled city residents.
4. Class 8 Part 2
    
    1. Weavers, Iron Smelters & Factory Owners
        
        1. By 1850s, Britain came to be known as **"workshop of the world"**. Before British conquered Bengal, India was by far the world's largest producer of cotton textiles. Europeans first saw the fine cotton cloth from India in Mosul, hence the name Muslin. Portuguese took back cotton from Calicut, calling it calico.
            
            1. **Chintz** (floral print), **cossaes** (or khassa) and **bandanna** are all Indian words which got popularized in Europe
            2. British govt **banned chintz by Calico Act**
            3. Some weaver communities - Tanti (Bengal), julahas, momin (North), sale, kaikollar, devangs (South).
        2. Rise of British industries and suppression of Indian cotton from world markets led to decline of Indian textiles. **By 1880s, 2/3 of India was wearing British manufactured clothes.** Only rich handloom clothing and coarse clothing worn by poor could survive this onslaught.
        3. Wootz (anglicized _ukku)_ **steel** was produced all over south India. Steel industry declined as British conquered more parts of India, introduced imported steel and enacted forest laws which devastated **small scale smelting** communities (such as **Agarias**).
    2. Civilizing the Native
        
        1. **William Jones, Henry Colbrooke and Nathaniel Halhed** set up Asiatic Society of Bengal and a journal called **Asiatick Researches**_._
        2. Orientalists believed that **ancient customs of the country and oriental learning** ought to be the basis of British rule in India.
        3. Anglicists believed that British effort should not be to teach what natives wanted in order to please them. Aim of education ought to be to **teach what was useful and practical.** These critics were James Mill & Thomas Macaulay.
            
            1. Following Macaulay's Minute, **English Education Act of 1835** was introduced. Medium of instruction for higher education was to be English and stop promotion of Orientalists institution.
            2. Woods' despatch 1854 - literature of East was not only **full of grave errors**, it could not instill in people a sense of duty, **nor skills required** for administration.
            3. Until 1813, Company opposed missionary activities for the fear of backlash from local population. Hence the missionaries set up a mission at **Serampore in an area** **under Danish control**. Printing press came up in 1800 and college in 1818.
        4. **William Adam** report on education in Bengal - 1 lakh pathshalas in Bengal & Bihar. Small institutions with around 20 students each. Fee **depended on income** of parents, teaching was **oral**, classes **not held during harvest time.** #important
            
            1. After company decided to improve vernacular system - decided to appoint **govt pandit in charge of 4-5 schools, fixed time table, annual exams**, teaching based on textbooks. Those who accepted got govt grants.
        5. Nationalists view
            
            1. Mahatma Gandhi deplored colonial education as it created **sense of inferiority** in minds of Indian and **lose self respect** in own culture. He valued lived experience and practical knowledge.
            2. Tagore started **Shantiniketan** in 1901 combining elements of modern western civilization and best of Indian traditions. Need to teach science and technology along with art, music and dance.
    3. Women & Caste Reform
        
        1. Ram Mohan Roy was keen to spread the knowledge of western education in country and bring about greater freedom and equality for women.
        2. Some women reformers in 19th century - **Pandita Ramabai** (founded **Sharda Sadan**, a widows' home at Poona and **Arya Mahila Samaj**) & **Tarabai Shinde** (published _Stripurushtulna)_
        3. **Satnami movement (Guru Ghansidas)** in Central India worked among **leatherworkers** to improve their social status. In East Bengal, Harshad Mehta's **Matua sect** worked among **Chandala cultivators.**
    4. Changing world of visual arts
        
        1. European artists brought the idea of **realism**, technique of **oil painting** (Indians not very familiar). Some trends - (a) Thomas and William Daniell were landscape artists. (b) Portrait paintings became popular with Indian nawabs c) **celebration of military triumph** - these were recurring themes as British power grew.
        2. Indian adaptation - scroll painters (called **patuas**) and potters developed a new style in **Kalighat**. Style was bold, **deliberate non-realistic** where figures emerge large and powerful. Themes were **political and social themes**. Even the poor could buy these.
        3. Raja Ravi Varma - created a style that was both **modern and national.** Became rage among Indian princes and art collectors. **Abanindranath Tagore (and pupil Nandlal Bose)** - this school **rejected Varma's style as imitative** and tried to capture **spiritual essence of the East,** and were inspired by miniature paintings and mural paintings of Ajanta.
    5. Making of National Movement
        
        1. Swadesi movement was known as **Vandematram movement in Deltaic Andhra**.
    6. India After Independence ￼
5. Class 9
    
    1. French Revolution - John Locke**, Rousseau** (The Social Contract) put forward the idea of a society based on **freedom and equal laws** and opportunities for all. ￼**Montesquieu** proposed division of power within govt bw legislative, executive and judiciary (The Spirit of Laws).
6. Class X - Part 2
    
    1. Nationalism in India
        
        1. Growth of modern nationalism is intimately connected to anti-colonial movement. People began **discovering their unity** in struggle with colonialism. Congress under Gandhi tried to forge various groups within one movement.
        2. WW1 created new economic and political turmoil. (a) Increase in defense expenditure financed by war loans and increasing taxes (b) forced recruitment to supply soldiers c) Crops failed in 1918-20 leading to acute shortage of food and **influenza epidemic (12-13 million perished).**
        3. Gandhi returned to India in Jan 1915. Idea of satyagraha emphasized power of truth and need to search for truth. **If cause was true, struggle was against injustice, then physical force not necessary to fight the oppressor**. Satyagrahi could win battle by appealing to conscience of oppressor. Gandhi believed dharma of non-violence could unite all Indians. Early satyagraha movements by Gandhi - Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad.
        4. Rowlatt Act 1919 - passed through **Imperial Legislative despite Indian opposition**. Gave govt power to **repress** political activities and **detention** of political prisoners for 2 years. Eventually led to Jalianwala Bagh massacre under General Dyer's command. Seeing violence spread (Chauri Chaura), Gandhi called off the movement.
        5. To launch a more broad based movement, needed rural support and unity of Hindu-Muslims. Gandhi took up the **Khilafat issue**. Ottoman Turkey was on losing side of WW1 and a harsh treaty was in works. In Calcutta session 1920, convinced Congress to start **non-cooperation in support of Khilafat and swaraj**. Why Non-Cooperation? British rule was established in India with the cooperation of Indians and will collapse if Indians refused to cooperate. However, **council elections of 1920** were on the minds of some Congress leaders.
        6. Non-Cooperation/Khilafat began in Jan 1921. Various social groups participated with **own specific aspiration.** //**Justice Party** in Madras was a non-Brahmanical party, founded by **Nair and Chetty**.
            
            1. Urban - movement started with **middle class participation** in cities. School students, teachers, lawyers. Foreign goods boycotted, foreign cloth burnt in bonfires. Merchants and traders refused to trade or finance foreign trade. But poor people couldn't afford khadi, alternative Indian institutions didn't come up
            2. Countryside - drew into **fold struggles of peasants and tribals**. Awadh Kisan Sabha by Nehru and Baba Ramachandra had come up to promote Non-Cooperation and integrate peasant struggle into wider struggle. However, it turned violent. Name of Gandhi was invoked to sanction all actions and aspirations.
            3. Tribals - interpreted the message of Gandhi in yet another way. Militant guerilla movement in **Gudem Hills AP led by Alluri Raju (Rampa Rebellion 1922)** who asserted use of force.
            4. Plantations - workers felt swaraj was **freedom to move freely and retaining links with their native villages**. Inland Emigration Act of 1859 prohibited them from leaving tea gardens without permission which was rarely given. They headed home after hearing of non-cooperation. Believed Gandhi raj was coming and everyone would get land in their own villages.
            5. Though social groups interpreted swaraj in own ways, they were **emotionally demanding and relating to an all-India agitation**. However movement turned violent in many places. CR Das and ML Nehru **argued return** to council politics. JLN and SCB **pressed for radical mass agitation**. Chauri Chaura incident brought an end to Non-Coop (police officials opened fire and were killed)
        7. Before Civil Disobedience - countryside in turmoil due to **effects of Great Depression** and Tory govt constitutes **Statutory Commission under John Simon** to look into functioning of constitutional system in India. Problem: No Indian member. Lord Irwin announced in October 1929 (a) **vague offer** of dominion status (b) **Round Table Conference**. December 1929 - Lahore Congress formalized demand of Purna Swaraj. **26 January 1930 as Independence Day**. Gandhi attempted to relate this to concrete everyday issues of life.
        8. Salt march and Civil Disobedience - Gandhi sent list of **11 wide-ranging demands** to Lord Irwin, most controversial was salt tax. If not fulfilled by 11 March, ultimatum to start a civil disobedience campaign. Dandi march was from Sabarmati to Dandi (240 km) for 24 days and urging people to peacefully defy the British. What was different from NCM? **Break colonial laws**. Following happened #important
            
            1. Colonial govt began arresting Congress leaders one by one. When Gandhi was arrested, supporters **attacked structures that symbolized British rule**. Govt responded with a policy of brutal repression.
            2. Gandhi-Irwin pact - participate in (2nd) Round Table Conference in London and in return political prisoners to be released. But negotiations broke down and back in India new cycle of repression had begun. Gandhi relaunched CDM but lost momentum by 1934.
        9. How people saw CDM
            
            1. Rich peasant communities **hard hit by Depression**. For them fight for swaraj was struggle against high revenues. Disappointed when movement called off in 1931 without revenue rates being revised.
            2. Poor peasantry - wanted **unpaid rent to landlord to be remitted**. Joined radical movements led by Socialists and Communists, which made relationship bw poor peasantry and Congress uncertain.
            3. Businessmen - keen on expanding business and protection from imports. Formed Indian Industrial Commercial Congress 1920 and FICCI 1927. Saw swaraj as time when trade and industry would flourish without constraints. But failure of Round Table **made them less enthusiastic**. Spread of militant activities, prolonged disruption of business and growing influence of socialism worried them. Congress was **reluctant to include industrial workers' demand.**
            4. Women - thousands of women came out of homes and participated, many went to jail. From **high caste** families and r**ich peasan**t households. Yet increased public role **didn't change way position** of women was perceived.
            5. Dalits - for long Congress ignored dailts for fear of **offending** conservative high caste Hindus. Gandhi championed their cause, **called them harijan** - children of god - and organized satyagraha to get them entry into public places. Dalit leaders saw a different political approach by organizing themselves and **demanded reserved seats** in education and separate electorate to choose Dalit members for legislative councils.
        10. BR Ambedkar organized Dalits into **Depressed Class Association in 1930** and clashed with Gandhi in 2nd RTC and demanded separate electorate, Gandhi started fast unto death. **Poona Pact 1932 bw Ambedkar and Gandhi** saw status of Schedule Castes getting reserved seats but in general electorate.
        11. After decline of Khilafat/NCM, large section of Muslims **felt alienated from Congress** which was visibly associated from 20s onwards with **Hindu religious nationalist** groups. Jinnah and Muslim League wanted **federal structure** in the Constitution on the lines of USA and reserved 1/3 seats in Central assembly but were shut down. CDM started under **atmosphere of distrust and suspicion** bw communities, Muslims could not respond to call for a united struggle.
        12. Nationalism - spreads when people begin to believe they are all part of same nation, some unity that binds them together. History and fiction, folklore and songs, popular prints and symbolism all played part in making of nationalism. **Bankim Chandra Chattopdhyay wrote Vande Mataram in 1870s**. Later included in his novel Anandamath and **widely sung during Swadesi** Movement in Bengal. Abanindranath Tagore painted Bharat Mata, devotion to this figure came to be seen as **evidence of one's nationalism.** ￼In late 19th century India, nationalists began recording folk tales to create a **true picture of traditional culture** that had been corrupted by outside forces. Rabindranath Tagore in Bengal and **Natesa Sastri** in Madras led folk revival. During Swadesi movement, **red green yellow** tricolor flag with **8 lotus and crescent** moon was designed. **By 1921, Gandhi designed** the swaraj flag - red green white with charkha in center.
        13. Efforts to unify people were not without problems - when past being glorified was Hindu, images celebrated taken from Hindu iconography, people of other communities felt left out.
    2. Print culture
        
        1. Print tech was developed in **China, Japan, Korea**. System of hand printing by rubbing paper. Oldest Japanese book is **Diamond Sutra.** Marco Polo took the **woodblock tech from China to Italy** in 13th century. **Johann Gutenberg** developed first known printing press in 1430s. First printed book using mechanical press was Bible.
        2. Earlier people lived in world of oral culture. Protestant Reformation can be attributed to printing technology.
        3. India - very rich tradition of handwritten manuscripts, **copied on palm leaves or handmade paper.** Pre-colonial Bengal had village primary schools where people learnt to write only.
        4. Printing press first came to Goa with Portuguese missionaries in mid-16th century. **James A Hickey started Bengal Gazette**, a weekly newspaper which was not part of Company (Hastings closed it).

        8. Censorship - after revolt of 1857, Vernacular Press Act was passed modelled on Irish Press Laws. Rights to censor reports and editorials in vernacular press.
    3. Novels, society
        
        1. Novel originated in Europe at a time **when it was colonizing** the rest of the world. Early novel contributed to colonialism by making readers feel they were part of a **superior community of fellow colonialists.**
        2. Stories in prose were not new to India. Earliest novels in modern India were written in Bengali and Marathi.

     8. Class 12 - part 1
    
    1. Theme 1
        
        1. **Harappan seal** - made of stone called **steatite**, contains animal motifs and signs - script **indecipherable**. Finds of rice are rare in Harappan. No clue if Harappan hunted wild animals or traded with hunting communities. Evidence of **ploughed field at Kalibangan**. Likely that **water from wells used for irrigation**. Water reservoir in **Dholavira** used to **store water** for agriculture. Vessels made of stone, metal and terracotta. Cities such as Kalibangan and Lothal had **fire altars,** where sacrifices may have been performed.
        2. Mohenjo-Daro - divided into Citadel and Lower stone. Citadel was walled, **physically separated** from the lower town. Lower town also walled. Settlement was first **planned and then implemented**, as all buildings were built on. Sun dried bricks were of **standard ratio**. Harappa cities - carefully planned drainage system. **Alexander Cunningham**, father of Indian **archaeology**. Citadel - warehouse and the great bath.
        3. Burials - dead were laid in pits. Graves contain **pottery and ornaments**. Valuable materials concentrated in Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa.
        4. **Chanhudaro** - **exclusively** devoted to **craft production** with variety of materials - precious stones, metals. Nageshwar and Balakot - bangles, ladles and inlay. #important
        5. Procuring materials - from **alluvial plains,** riverine routes, coastal routes. Shortughai (lapis lazuli, high value blue stone) is in Afghanistan. Expeditions to other communities. Omani (Magan) copper and Harappan artifacts have **common origins**. **Mesopotamia called Harappa region of Meluhha.** The earliest traces of **cotton known anywhere** in the world have been found in the Valley. #important
        6. Seals, scripts and weights - seals were used to facilitate long distance trade and communication. Harappan seal had writing (**right to left**) + **motifs for those who couldn't read**. Writing was found on variety of items => were most people literate? Weights - made of stone called **chert, cubical** in shape.
        7. Authority - **no identifiable power** of authority. Parallel of priest king of Mesopotamia found in Indus. **Single state theory** - similarity in artifacts, planned settlements, standardized ratio of brick size and settlements near sources of raw materials. **Unlikely entire communities could have collectively** made and implemented such complex decisions.
        8. Decline - after 1900 BCE **disappearance of distinctive** artifacts of civilization, ritual way of life in Late Harappa cultures. Discovery time - Cunningham used **Chinese pilgrim accounts** to locate and excavate sites. Daya Ram Sahni and Rakhal Das Banerji - found seals at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. **John Marshall - announced discovery of Indus Valley to the world 1924**. Mound - build up of occupational debris. Study of sterile layers is called **stratigraphy.**
        9. Wheeler - DG ASI 1944 - followed the stratigraphy of the mound rather than uniform digging up of an area, for **military precision** to practice of archaeology.
        10. Piecing together - classifying finds - material, function. Reconstruction of history made on assumption that later tradition provide parallels with earlier ones. Issue of gender work haven't been investigated till now.
    2. Kings, Farmers and Towns (600 BCE to 600 AD)
        
        1. Emergence of early states, empires and kingdoms. New modes of disposal of dead - including **making of megaliths (iron age)**. 1830s **James Princep, deciphered Brahmi and Kharosthi**, scripts used in earliest inscriptions and coins. Led to reconstruct lineage of major dynasties.
        2. Earliest states - 16 mahajanapadas. 6th century BCE major turning point in early Indian history, era associated with early states, cities and growing use of iron, use of coins etc. Growth of diverse systems of thoughts including Buddhism and Jainism. Some mahajanapadas had power sharing arrangements - collectively by people called Rajas. Mahavir and Buddha belonged to such janas. **Vajji** - controlled resources collectively.
        3. Inscriptions are writings engraved on hard surfaces such as stone, metal or pottery. Earliest inscriptions **were in Prakrit**. Brahma sutras composed by Brahmins in 6th century BCE. Rulers advised
        4. Bw 6th and 4th century - **Magadha became most powerful mahajanapada**. Why - esp agriculturally productive region. Iron mines were accessible. Elephants, imp part of army, found in forests. Ganga and tributaries - cheap and convenient communication. But more importantly - **ambitious kings.**
        5. **Jatakas were written in Pali**. Agriculture production increased because of iron **tipped ploughshare and transplantation**. Manusmriti best known legal text of early India, advising the king what to do.
        6. Successful merchants were called masattuvan in Tamil and setthis in Prakrit. First coins to **use name and images of rulers** were used in 2nd century BCE by **Indo-Greek rulers**. First gold coins by Kushanas in 1st century AD. Coins (mainly copper) were also issued by tribal republics of Punjab and Haryana called the Yaudheyas.
        7. Most scripts used to write modern Indian languages are derived from **Brahmi**, worked backwards from Bengali and Devanagari to decipher. Kharosthi - coins of Indo Greeks has names of kings in Greek and **Kharosthi**. Brahmi is written left to right, while Kharosthi is written right to left. Used till 4th AD.
    3. Kinship, Caste and Class - early societies (600 BCE - 600 AD)
        
        1. Critical Edition of Mahabharata - under leadership of V.S. Sukthankar, project took 47 years to complete. 2 thing emerged - several common elements in Sanskrit version & enormous legal variations.
        2. Kinship and marriage - **kula (families), jati (larger network of kinfolk), vamsha (lineage)**. Patrilineal means tracing descent from father, matrilineal is tracing through mother. While **patrilineal existed prior** to composition of Mahabharata, it **reinforced the idea** that it was valuable. Endogamy - refers to marriage within a unit, exogamy - outside the unit, polygyny - man having several wives, polyandry - women having many husbands.
            
            1. Challenge of **various beliefs and practises merging** led to creation of Dharamasutras by Brahmans, most important work was **Manusmriti**. 8 forms of marriage - 4 good (Brahma, Prajapatya, Daiva, Arsha vivaah) 4 bad.
            2. Gotra of women - **from 1000 BCE** esp Brahmans classified in terms of gotras. Each gotra named **after Vedic seer.** 2 important rules - women give up their father's gotras and **members of same gotras can't marry**. Satvahanas women didn’t necessarily follow the latter. Metronymic - name derived from mother/female ancestor -> list of generations of teachers and students contained in Brihadarayanka Upanishad (Yajurveda, principal upanishad)
            3. Mothers were important? **No definite conclusion**. //Temple in **Ahichchhatra** (UP) - earliest sculpture depiction of scene from Mahabharata in terracotta sculpture
        3. **Caste** - ideal order laid down in **Dharmasutras and dharmashastras**, also contained rules about the **ideal occupations of 4 varnas.**
            
            1. Brahamanas - study and teach vedas, perform sacrifices, give/receive gifts. Kshatriyas - engage in warfare, protect people, administer justice, study the vedas, get sacrifices performed, give gifts. Vaishyas - engage in agriculture, pastoralism, trade, study vedas, get sacrifices performed and make gifts. **Shudras - only occupation - serve the higher varnas**. 2-3 strategies to enforce norms - assert varna was of **divine order** (quoted **Purusha sukta from Rigveda**, describing sacrifice of purusha, the primeval man); advised kings to ensure norms were followed; persuaded people that their status was determined **by birth** (reinforced by stories told in Mahabharata and other texts, story of Drona-Eklavya).
            2. Non-kshatriya kings - political power was **open to anyone** who could support and resources, (shashtras said only kshatriya could be kings). Outsider rulers were called **mlechchhas** (**barbarians**) by Brahmana. However **Rudradaman** (Saka ruler) rebuilt Sudarshan lake (Junagadh inscription in Sanskrit). **Gotami-puta Satakani** claimed to both ek Bamahana and destroyer of pride of Kshatriyas. **Ensured no intermarriage amongst member of 4 varnas** but married kin of Rudradaman (outsider) himself.
            3. Social mobility - **nishada** (a hunting community to which Eklavya belonged to). **Varnas were fixed but jatis were unlimited.** Jatis were assigned which didn't easily fit into the varna system. Jati shared a **common occupation** and sometimes organized into shrenis or guilds. Mandasor (MP ) inscription records history of emigration of a guild of silk weave workers. **Vanik** - term to designate merchants (//**Mrichchhakatika written by Shudraka,** 4th century AD). The term rakshasa is maybe used to describe people whose practice differed from Brahamnical texts.
            4. Untouchables - it rested on notion that certain activities connected with performance of rituals and by extension pure and **some activities polluting** (handling corpses and dead animals). Chandalas - those who did it were classified as untouchables. Manusmriti - laid down duties of chandalas, live outside the village, use discarded utensils, wear clothes of the dead and ornaments of iron. F**a Xian wrote how they had to sound a clapper** so that people would know they are coming and not see them. Matanga Jataka (pali text, Bodhisatta in previous birth was chandala).
        4. Resources and status - according to Manusmriti, paternal estate was to be divided **equally amongst sons with special share for eldest**, women no claim. Women allowed to retain gifts they received at time of marriage called **stridhana**, **husband can't claim.** Social difference bw men and women were sharpened cos of differences in access of resources. Way to acquire wealth - 7 for men and 6 for women.
            
            1. Buddhist text in Pali - Majjhima Nikaya, part of dialog between Avantiputtta and Kachchana - talked about the wealthy shudra. **Puranaruru** - anthologies of poems of Tamil sangam.
            2. The word **Nikaya** is most commonly used in reference to the Buddhist texts of the **Sutta Piṭaka**.
        5. Social differences -  Buddhists also developed an alternative understanding of social inequalities. In a myth found in a text known as the Sutta Pitaka, they suggested that originally human beings did not have fully evolved bodily forms, nor was the world of plants fully developed. All beings lived in an idyllic state of peace, taking from nature only what they needed for each meal.
        6. Mahabharata - divided into 2 broad sections - narrative and didactic but no watertight division. Original story was probably composed by **charioteer-bards** known as **sutas**. From 5th century BCE, **Brahamanas took over and began to write** (mahajanpadas time period).
        7. Timeline of texts
            
            1. 500 BCE **Ashtadhyayi, Panini** - work on Sanskrit grammar #remember-for-later

    4. Thinkers, beliefs & buildings (600 BCE - 600 AD)
        
        1. Great stupa at Sanchi - **rulers of Bhopal -** Shahjehan Begum and Sultan Jehan Begum provided money for preservation. John Marshall (ASI)
        2. Mid-first millennium BCE **(around 500 BCE) is often regarded as turning point** in world history - emergence of thinkers such as **Zarathustra (Iran), Kong Zi (China), Socrates, Aristotle & Plato, Mahavira & Gautam Buddha**.
            
            1. Several pre-existing traditions of though, religious belief and practice. Rigveda compiled between 1500-1000 BCE, consists of hymns in praise of variety of deities - **Agni, Indra, Soma.** At first, sacrifices were performed collectively, later, by heads of households for well being of domestic unit. Elaborate sacrifices such as Rajasuya (consecration ceremony), Asvamedha (horse sacrifice) and **Vajpeya (chariot races, and gifts to courtiers)** performed by kings and chiefs through Brahmana priests.
            2. Most prominent river of the Rigveda is the **Sarasvati, next to the Indus.**
            3. People were curious about meaning of life, life after death. Debates and discussions took place in **kutagarashala** - **hut with a pointed roof** or in groves where travelling mendicants halted. Many of these teachers, including Mahavira and Buddha, questioned authority of the vedas. //Chandogya Upanishad (Sama Veda) - verses on nature of self and true sacrifice. #important
            4. Buddhist texts - Teachings of Buddha **compiled at Vaishali,** known as Tripitaka - 3 baskets to hold different types of texts.
                
                1. Vinaya Pitaka - rules and regulations for those who joined the sangh
                2. Sutta Pitaka - Buddha's teaching were included in here
                3. Abhidhamma Pitaka - dealt with philosophical matters.
                4. Other texts such as **Dipavamsa** (chronicle of **island**), **Mahavamsa** (**great** chronicle) - written in Pali contain **regional** (Sri Lankan) histories of Buddhism
            ![1st council— Rajgriha, 400 BC 2nd council — Vaishali, 383 BC 3rd council— Patliputra, Patronage Ajatshatru Kalasoka Ashoka Presidency Mahakashyapa Sabakami Moggaliputta Tissa ](Exported%20image%2020250424103630-2.tiff)6. Fatalists - tradition of Ajivikas (teacher **Makkhali Gosala**); says that the wise and the fool cannot come out of karma. It can neither be lessened nor increased. So fool and wise alike will take their course and make an end of sorrow.
            7. Materialists reject Vedas, Vedic ritualism, and supernaturalism - tradition of Lokayatas (or Charvaka), philospher **Ajita Kesakambalin and Brihaspati**). Believe that everything is not predetermined. Human being is made up of the four elements
            8. Jain tradition - Mahavira was preceded by **23 other tirthankaras** - meaning those who **guide people across river of existence**. Most important idea in Jainism is that entire world is **animated**. Non-injury to living beings is central to the philosophy. Principle of ahimsa, emphasized within Jainism. Cycle of birth and rebirth is shaped through karma; to free oneself **asceticism and penance is required**. Which can be achieved only by renouncing the world hence **monastic existence is necessary condition of salvation**. Jain monks and nuns took 5 vows
                
                1. Abstain from **killing, stealing and lying**; observe **celibacy**; abstain from possessing **property**. //Uttaradhyayana Sutta - queen Kamalavati tried to persuade her husband to renounce the world.
            
            Spread of Jainism - scholars produced wealth of literature in - **Prakrit, Sanskrit and Tamil.** Earliest stone sculptures associated with religious traditions were from Jain devotees.
            
        3. Buddha and his hagiography (biography of religious leader) - born Siddhartha in Sakya clan in **Lumbini**, he had a sheltered upbringing. First journey to outside world was traumatic - saw an old man, sick man and a corpse. Decay and destruction of human body was inevitable. Saw a homeless mendicant who came to terms with old age, disease and death, and found peace. Siddhartha decided to adopt the same path. Explored several paths including bodily mortification but abandoned it. **Meditated for several days and attained enlightenment at Bodh Gaya**. Called Buddha or the Enlightened One. Taught **dhamma or the path of righteous living** for the rest of his life. Gave first sermon at **Sarnath** and attained nirvana at **Kusinagara**.
        4. Teachings of Buddha - Reconstructed from stories **mainly found in Sutta Pitaka**. According to Buddhist philosophy, **world is transient (anicca) and constantly changing.** It is **soulless (anatta)** as there is **nothing permanent** in it. Within transient world, sorrow (dukkha) is **intrinsic to human existence.** By following the path of moderation between severe penance and self indulgence that human beings can rise above worldly troubles. **In earliest forms of Buddhism, whether or not god existed was irrelevant.** Social world was creation of humans rather than divine origin, hence advised kings and gahapatis to be **humane and ethical**. Emphasized individual agency and righteous action as the means to escape from cycle of rebirth and attain self realization and nirvana.
        5. Followers of Buddha - **Ananda**, Buddha's disciple, persuaded Buddha **to allow women** into sanghas. Buddha's foster mother, **Mahapajapati Gotami**, first woman to be ordained. Many went on to become teachers of dhamma and **theris** (respected women who had attained liberation). Therigatha - collection of short poem of elder nuns. Part of Khuddaka Nikaya within Sutta Pitaka (Theravada Buddhism)￼The importance attached to conduct and values **rather than claims of superiority based on birth**, emphasis on metta (fellow feeling) and karuna (compassion) were ideas that dew people to Buddhist teachings. #important
        6. Stupas - //Chaityas derived from the word chita and by extension meaning a **funerary mound**. Tradition of erecting stupas **was pre-Buddhist** but came to be associated with Buddhism. They contained some relics so entire stupa was **venerated as emblem** of Buddha and Buddhism. **Asokavandana** - Asoka distributed portion of Buddha's relics to **every important town** and ordered construction of stupa over them . Eg Bharhut, Sanchi and Sarnath. #important
            
            1. Structure of stupas
            2. ![LL ](Exported%20image%2020250424103632-3.tiff)
            3. **Elliot marbles** - Walter Elliot collected sculpture panels of **Amravati stupa** were called so. H.H. Cole to the rescue of the structure.
            4. **Shalabhanjika** - woman whose touch **caused trees to flower and bear fruit**. People who turned to Buddhism enriched it with their non-Buddhist beliefs such as these. Early sculptures didn't show Buddha in human form but through symbols - **stupa was representation of mahanirvana, wheel - stood for first sermon of Buddha.**
            5. Paintings at Ajanta depict **stories from Jatakas.**
        7. New religious traditions - 1st century AD evidence of changes in Buddhist ideas and practices. **Bodhisatta perceived as deeply compassionate** beings who accumulated merit through their efforts but **didn't attain nirvana to help others**. Worship of Buddha and Bodhisattas became important part of this tradition. New way of thinking called **Mahayana - literally the great vehicle**. Followers of older tradition describe themselves as **theravadins, path of the old.**
        8. Growth of Puranic Hinduism - notion of savior not unique Buddhism. Similar ideas in Hinduism - Vaishnavism (Vishnu worshipped as principal deity) and Saivism (Shiva the chief god). Bond between the devotee and god visualized as one of love & devotion (bhakti).
            
            1. Vaishnavism - 10 avatars recognized within the tradition, recognizing local deities was one way of **creating more unified religious traditions**. Puranas compiled by Brahmanas by 500 AD included stories about gods and goddesses. Written in **simple Sanskrit and meant to be read aloud to everybody (incl women and Shudras)** who didn't have access to Vedic learning. One could attain the grace of God irrespective of one’s caste status
            2. Early temples (3rd century AD) were square room called **garbhagriha** with a single door. Gradually shikhara, tall structure over central shrine. Some early temples - hollowed out of huge rocks as **artificial caves (for renouncers of Ajivija sect)**. By 8th century - carved entirely out of rock, temples such as Kailashnatha temple at Ellora.
9. Class 12 part II
    
    1. Travelers (10th-17th AD)
        
        1. **Women travelers did exist** but no account left. **Al-biruni - Uzbekistan** - 11th century. Ibn Battuta - Morocco - 14th century. **Bernier - France - 17th century**. Others who visited India - Abdur Razzaq Samarqandi, Mahmud Wali Balkhi, Shaikh Ali Hazin, **Marco Polo.**
        2. **Al-biruni and Kitab ul Hind** (founder of Indology)**.** Was a hostage of **Mahmud Ghazni** and traveled widely in Punjab and Northern India. Kitab-ul-hind is written in Arabic - covers variety of subjects. He depended mostly on Vedas, Puranas, Gita, Patanjali and Manusmriti for his understanding of Indian society. Thought that caste system was contrary to laws of nature. **Antyaja** - born outside the system / untouchables - were inexpensive labor to peasants.
        3. Ibn Battuta wrote **Rihla** in Arabic - rich and interesting details about social and cultural life of 14th century. Was a qazi for **Muhammad bin Tughlaq at Delhi**. Marco Polo was his **contemporary**. Described coconut and paan to the foreign audience (NCERT sigh). He noted the network of trade and commerce links subcontinent had with Indian products in great demand. Efficient system of postal communication - **uluq** (run by royal horses) & **dawa** (foot post, meaning 1/3 of a mile).
        4. Francois Bernier - compared **Mughal empire with contemporary Europe**, canvassing Europe as the superior civilization. **Found crown ownership of property as harmful to both state and people**. Asserted that there is no middle class in India. Was a champion of **private property**. No Mughal document **suggests that state** was sole owner of land. Bernier's description influenced Western theorists - **idea of oriental despotism** developed by Montesquieu. In 17th century around 15% of Indian population lived in towns (higher than Western Europe). Merchants were organized into caste-cum-occupational bodies called **mahajans**, and chief sheth.
        5. Women, slaves & satis - slaves were common, sometimes **used as a spy**, generally for domestic labor.
    2. Bhakti-Sufi traditions (8th to 18th century AD)
        
        1. Wide range of gods and goddesses in sculpture as well as in texts. Integration of cults happened - by disseminating of Brahmanical ideas to others & Brahmanas **accepting and reworking beliefs** of the others. E.g. Jagannatha was identified as a form of Vishnu. **Great traditions** (emanated from ruler and priestly class) and **little traditions** (local practices). Local deities were incorporated **within Puranic framework** with an identity as wife of principal male deity. Forms of worship associated with **goddess were classified as Tantric**, influenced Saivism & Buddhism.
        2. Vedic vs Puranic traditions - principal deity of **Vedic pantheon were Agni, Indra and Soma, which get marginalized while authority of Vedas is still unchallenged**. Vishnu, Shiva and goddess **were in Vedic mantras** but little in common with Puranic mythologies.
        3. In course of evolution of forms of worship, poet-saints emerged as leaders around whom community of devotees developed. These tradition **accommodated women and lower castes.** Bhakti traditions can be classified into 2 broad categories - **saguna** (with attributes, Shiva Vishnu Devi) and **nirguna** (without attributes, abstract form of god).
            
            1. Earliest bhakti movements were by Alvars (immersed in devotion to Vishnu) and Nayanars (leaders who were Shiva devotees).
            2. **Nalayira Divyaprabandham** - major anthology of composition by 12 Alvars. Tondaradippodi, Andal, - were some prominent Alvars. **Bhagvata Purana** was a result of incorporation of ideas of **Tamil bhakts within Sanskritic tradition.** #important
            3. **Tevaram** - consists of poems by Appar, Sampandhar and Sundarar during the 12th century. There were 63 major Nayanars. **Karaikkal Ammaiyar** was a woman. **Manikkavacakar was not** a Nayanar.
            4. One of the major themes of Tamil bhakti hymns is **opposition to Buddhism and Jainism** because of competition between members of religious tradition for **royal patronage**. Chola rulers supported Brahmanical and Bhakti traditions (Shiva and Vishnu temples constructed). Vellala peasants revered both Nayanars and Alvars.
            5. **Chaitanya Mahaprabhu** - Chaitanya was a saint from **Bengal**. He was a devotee of **Lord Krishna**. Though he was a Brahman he condemned the caste system and emphasized on the equality of all. Founded **Gaudiya Vaishnavism in 15th century.**
        4. Virashaiva - 12th century movement in Karnataka led by **Basavanna, followers were called Virashaivas or Lingayats**. They worship Shiva in his **manifestation as a linga. Jangama** or **wandering monks** are also revered by them. They believe that on death the devotee will be u**nited with Shiva and not return** to this world - **bury the dead and not cremate.** Lingayats challenged the idea of caste and pollution by Brahmanas and **questioned the theory of rebirth**. Encouraged idea of **post-puberty marriage and remarriage of widows** - which was disapproved by Dharmashastras. #important
        5. The emergence of Rajput states led to consolidation of Brahmanas with the ruling elites in North India. Non-Brahmanical leaders such as **Naths, Jogis, Siddhas** from artisanal groups **questioned the authority of vedas** but couldn't win support of ruling elites. However establishment of Delhi Sultanate undermined power of Rajput states and associated Brahamanas.
        6. **Muhammad Qasim** conquered Sind in 711 - first invasion by Muslim in Indian subcontinent, which eventually led to Sultanate and Mughal empire. Muslim rulers were to be guided by **ulama who were to ensure shari'a**. Shari'a is based on **Quran, hadis, qiyas** (reasoning by analogy) and **ijma** (consensus by community). Non muslims paid **jizya** to be in the category of **zimmi** (protected). All those who adopted Islam accepted its 5 pillars - there is one god Allah and Muhammad is his messenger (shahada), offering prayers 5 times a day (namaz/salat), giving alms (zakat), fasting during month of Ramzan (sawm/roza) and performing the pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj).
            
            1. **Khojas, a Shia sect, wrote Ginans** (devotional hymns) in Khojaki script which was derived from local landa script.
            2. **Mlechchha** - migrant communities which didn't observe norms of caste society.
        7. Growth of Sufism - group of religious minded people turned to **asceticism and mysticism** in protest against growing materialism of Caliphate. Regarded Muhammad as a **perfect** human being. **Sufism = tasawwuf**. By 11th century, Sufism evolved into a well developed movement. Sufis began to organize communities around **khanqas** controlled by teaching master - **shaikh, pir, mushird** - who enrolled disciples _murid_ and appointed successor _khalifa._
            
            1. Silsila literally means a chain, signifying continuous link between master and disciple. When shaikh died, his tomb _dargah_ became center of devotion. **Practice of pilgrimage** **ziyarat** to his grave, on his death anniversary or urs. People sought their blessings to attain material and spiritual benefits, evolving the **cult of wali** (plural auliya). **Qawwali is part of ziyarat.** Sufis remember god by reciting divine names _zikr_ or sama (literally audition).
            2. Those mystics who **ignored rituals** - **Qalandars, Madaris, Malangs, Haidaris** - were referred to as **be-sharia** as they defied sharia.
        8. **Chistis** - migrated to India in late 12th century, adapted successfully to local environment. The big 5 - Moinuddin Chishti, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, Fariduddin Ganjshakar, Nizamuddin Auliya and Nasiruddin Chirag Dehlavi. **Khanqa was the center of social life**. Open kitchen run on **futuh** (unasked for charity). **Shaikh Nizamuddin** appointed several successors and deputed them to set up hospice in various parts leading to rapid spread of the order. Most famous was Khwaja Muinuddin Chisti (aka Garib Nawaz). Amir Khusrau, disciple and friend of Auliya, introduced qual.
            
            1. Masnavis is long poem written by Rumi
            2. Padmavat was composed by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, romance of Padmini and Ratansen
            3. Poems written in Dakhani (Deccani urdu) sung by women doing household work, lurinama (lullabies) and shadinama (wedding songs).
            4. **Vachanas by Lingayats** and **Abhangs by Pandharpur warkaris** (god Vithoba) also inspired Sufism. //Dhyaneswar & Tukaram are saints of warkaris.
        
        Sufis accepted unsolicited grants and donations from political elites. Charitable trusts (**auqafs**) and tax free lands (**inam**).
        
        10. Kabir 14th century - verses ascribed to Kabir are in 3 distinct but overlapping traditions - **Kabir Bijak** (by Kabirpanth in Varanasi and UP), **Kabir Granthwali** (Dadupanth Rajasthan), **Adi Granth Sahib.**
            
            1. Poems are in several languages and dialects; including **santbhasha (gurmukhi). Ulatbansi** - everyday meanings are inverted, fire raging in the ocean.
            2. Kabir drew range of traditions to describe the Ultimate Reality - **khuda, alakh, shabda, shunya.**
            3. Kabir and his rich corpus of verses present source of inspiration for those who **questioned entrenched religious** and social institutions, ideas and practice in search of divine. His guru was Ramananda, but that is contested.
        11. Baba Guru Nanak - born into a Hindu family in a Muslim Punjab. Advocated a form of **nirguna bhakti.** Rejected sacrifices, ritual baths, image worship, austerities and scriptures of both religions. Expressed his ideas through hymns called **shabad** in Punjabi. He sang while attendant **Mardana played rabab**. Appears that Nanak **didn't want to establish a religion**. 5th guru, Guru Arjan, compiled Nanak's hymns and the 4 successors along with **Baba Farid, Raidas, Kabir** in Adi Granth Sahib. Hymns called gurbani in various languages. 10th guru, Guru Gobind, included 9th Guru Teg Bahadur's composition and this was finally **Guru Granth Sahib.**
            
            1. **Pahul was the sanctified water** offered by a master to the pupil or shishya as a token of his being accepted as a trainee on his march to godliness. The Sikhs performed “washing of the swords” ceremony, called **khande ka pahul**, evolving as the pir-muridi custom
        12. Mirabai - 15/16th century. Was married to a prince of Sisodia clan. Defied the traditional role and recognized Krishna as her lover. **Guru was perhaps Raidas. Raskhan**, a Muslim poet, was a devotee of Lord Krishna.
        13. Shankaradeva - late 15th century, leading proponent of **Vaishnavism in Assam**. His teachings are known as **Bhagavati** dharma, based on Gita and Puranas. Need for **naam kirtan, sat sang and satra** (monasteries) for transmission of spiritual knowledge. Major composition is **kirtana-ghosha**.
    3. Vijayanagara (14th-16 century) - _aka Karnataka Samrajyamu_
        
        1. People remembered the city as **Hampi** (named after **Pampadevi**). Oral traditions, archaeological finds, monuments & inscriptions helped reconstruct the empire. ￼**Discovery of Hampi - brought about by Colin Mackenzie** (1st Surveyor General of India 1815).
        2. **Harihara & Bukka** founded Vijayanagara Empire is 1336, had different religions & different languages within. Rulers built on rich traditions of **Cholas & Hoysalas.** Warfare was dependent on effective cavalry, import of horses was crucial. Local merchants **kudirai chettis** participated in this as well as Arab traders. Trade was status symbol of these cities - spices, textiles & precious stones. **Revenue from trade contributed to prosperity of state.**
        3. **Had 5 dynasties** - Sangama, Saluvas, Tuluva, Aravidu - that order. Krishnadeva Raya's rule was that of expansion and consolidation. Acquired - Raichur doab, Odisha subdued, Sultan of Bijapur defeated. Addition of gopuram to many important temples was the highlight of his rule. New township - Nagalapuram after his mother. Wrote **Amuktamalyada**, work on **statecraft in Telugu**. #important
        4. Successors were troubled by **nayakas** (military chiefs). Military ambitions of rulers of Vijayanagara led to **alliance of Sultans against them.** Rama Raya led army into battle at **Rakshasi-Tangadi** (Talikota) and got routed. Hampi was sacked and eventually deserted. Relations bw Sultans and Rayas were not always hostile, **Rama Raya is blamed for adventurism** which led to Sultans combining against him. //**Yavana** is used for Greek and others who entered subcontinent through north west.
        5. Nayakas - controlled forts and had armed supporters. Often rebelled and had to be subdued by military action. **Amara-nayaka** system was major political innovation of Vijayanagara empire, most likely **derived from iqta system** of Delhi Sultanate. **Amara-nayaka were military commanders** who were given territories to govern by raya, collected taxes and other dues. Part of revenue used for own army maintenance, temples, rest for empire. Kings asserted their control by transferring them. By 17th century, many nayakas established independent kingdoms.
        6. **Vijayanagara** - was written about by - Nicolo de Conti, Abdur Razzaq, Afanasii Nikitin (all 15th century). Barbosa, Paes, Nuniz (16th century). Location feature - natural **basin formed by Tungabhadra** which flows in NE direction, surrounded by granite hills with number of streams. One of **most arid zones** in peninsula, hence elaborate arrangement to **store rainwater and conduct** to city. Most imp - **Kamalapuram** tank. Hiriya canal was used for irrigation, built by **Sangamas**. Forts encircled not just the city but also hinterland and forests. No mortar or cementing agent, stone blocks were wedged together. Agricultural tracts were incorporated within fortified area - to protect the agricultural belt and thus outlast any siege against the kingdom. Gateways with arch and dome were influenced from Indo-Islamic features. #important
            
            1. Urban core - entire area dotted with numerous shrines and small temples, supported by different communities. Tanks, wells were sources of water.
            2. Royal center - included over 60 temples, patronage of cult and temples was important as it justified divine authority. Superstructure of secular buildings was made of perishable materials such as **mahanavami dibba**. Massive platform on base 11k sq ft, base covered with relief carvings. **Audience hall high platform with slots for wooden pillars**. Their use remains an enigma.
            3. Other buildings in royal center - **Lotus Mahal** (may have been **meeting place** with advisors), Elephant stables, **Hazara Rama** (used by **king and family**).
            4. Sacred center - Pampadevi did penance in the hills to marry Virupaksha (Shiva), guardian deity of kingdom. This area has **Jain temples from pre-Vijayanagara** time as well. Temple building was encouraged - to give divine authority to king and use as learning center. Vijayanagara kings claimed to rule on behalf of god **Virupaksha**.
                
                1. Hindu Suratrana - **early** Vijayanagara rulers called themselves this.
            5. Gopuram & mandapas - mark of imperial authority. Halls in temples were used for a variety of purposes - music, dance, drama, marriages. **Vittala**, form of Vishnu worshipped in Maharashtra, has a temple in **Hampi**. Temple complexes had chariot streets from gopuram which served as markets.
            6. Mackenzie, Greenlaw, Fleet, Marshall - all were instrumental in discovery and conservation of Vijayanagara. **1986** declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
    4. Peasants, Zamindars and the State (Mughals)
        
        1. Basic unit of agricultural society was the village. Major understanding of the time doesn't come from peasants as they did not write about themselves. 16th & 17th century chronicles from Mughal court. **Abul Fazl Ain-i-Akbari** recorded arrangements made by state to ensure cultivation. Provided a view from the top - vision of Akbar's empire where social harmony was provided by a strong ruling class.
        2. Peasants - term to describe **raiyat, muzarian, kisan or asami. Khud-khasta** (**resident** of village in which they held their lands) or **pahi-khasta** (**non-resident** cultivators). Avg peasant had a pair of bullocks and 2 ploughs; most even less. 10 acres holdings were rich peasants. Peasants were **generally mobile,** as there was abundant land as well (as noticed by Babur).
        
        Irrigation - abundance of land, labor and mobility accounted for expansion of agriculture. Tobacco first came in **Deccan** and spread to Northern India in early 17th century. Crops such as **cotton and sugarcane** were jins-i-kamil (perfect crops) as they got state more revenue. New world crops - **Potato, tomato, maize, chilies, pineapple, papaya.**
        
        4. Village community - constituents were cultivators, panchayat and village headman (**muqaddam or mandal**). Large section was constrained by position in caste hierarchy and relegated to poverty. Muslims had such communities as well - **halalkhoran** (scavengers) & **mallahzadas** (boatmen). Caste-poverty-social status were directly correlated in lower society. Village headmen - chosen through consensus of village elders and ratified by zamindars, work was supervise preparation of **village account assisted by patwari (called Kanungo in Punjab)**. Panchayat also ensured caste boundaries were upheld (marriages in presence of mandal). Jati had own jati panchayat which resolved civil disputes. Lower class peasants could resist oppression by deserting the village.
        5. Artisans - cultivators could engage in craft production while there was lull in agricultural activity. Artisans could be paid by way of harvest or **allotment of land** (called **watan** or miras). **Jajmani** system - **remuneration of services with small daily allowance and diet money**. Wasn't a little republic as British officials thought, **deep inequalities** wrt to asset ownership and status.
        6. Women in agrarian society - entire household was labor for production, men tilled and ploughed while women sowed, weeded, threshed and winnowed. Biases related to women's biological functions did continue. **Artisanal and commercialized product were dependent on women's labor**. Considered an important resource because child bearer in society dependent on labor. But high mortality rates among women - pregnancy, child birth, malnutrition - led to shortage of wives. Non-elite groups considered remarriage among widowed and divorced women. **Fear of losing them was great, hence kept under strict control**. Among landed gentry, women had the right to inherit property (Rajshahi zamindari).
        7. Forests and tribes - forests were a **subversive place for the state**, trouble makers who take refuges (**mawas**). Chandimangala is a Bengali poem composed by Mukundaram Chakrabarti - talks about clearing of forests. Spread of commercial agriculture and great demand of forest produce (honey, elephants) brought forest dwellers in close contact with state. **Forest chieftains turned zamindars and kings** (Ahom kings and their slave army paiks). Capture of wild elephants became royal monopoly.
        8. Zamindars - did not directly participate in **process of production.** Caste was one factor of elevated status, another was khidmat (services) for the state. They held **personal lands**, termed **milqiyat**, often used cultivators and meant for private use. (1) often collect revenue (2) forts and armed contingent. They spearheaded colonization of agricultural land, and settled cultivators. Little doubt that zamindars were exploitative, relationship with peasantry was based on **reciprocity, paternalism and patronage.** Why - sufis didn't condemn zamindars and moneylenders as oppressors, agrarian uprisings involved peasant support for zamindar against the state.
        9. Land revenue system - Revenue from land was mainstay of Mughals, diwan was responsible for **supervising the fiscal system** of empire. Jama was amount assessed and hasil was amount collect (in both cash and kind) - duties of **amil-guzar** (**revenue collector**). **In kind was collected** through kankut, bhaoli, khet batai, lang batai. Amin was official responsible for **ensuring imperial regulations** were carried out in provinces. ￼Italian traveler Giovanni Careri wrote about flow of silver and India.
        10. Ain-i-akbari- was the 3rd book of Akbar Nama and was organized as collection of imperial regulations and gazetteer of empire. Important to **deconstruct life under Mughal empire** but it's still an imperial view of state of affairs. Ain is made up of 5 books - (1) manzil-abadi (imperial household and maintenance) (2) sipah-abadi (military and civil administration) (3) mulk-abadi (fiscal side of empire and revenue system). It gives a detailed and highly complex view of agrarian society including **suba, sarkar, pargana, mahal divisions**. 4th and 5th book contain religious, literary and cultural traditions. Ain had its limitations but gives a fascinating glimpse into the structure and organization of Mughal empire and quantitative information about its people and products. Enables historians to reconstruct the social fabric of that time. //Blochmann & Jarett translated it in 3 volumes.
    5. Kings and Chronicles - Mughals
        
        1. Mughals referred to themselves as **Timurids**, descendants of Turkish ruler Timur on paternal side. Babur was related to **Genghiz** Khan from his mother's side. Chronicles of Mughal emperors had 3 purposes - project vision of an **enlightened kingdom, convey that resistance is futile, account of rule for posterity**. Written in Persian, flourished from Sultanate times and prospered under Akbar as language of court. Urdu sprang from interaction of **Hindi and Persian.** Mahabharata was translated as **Razmnama**.
        2. All books were **manuscripts (handwritten) and imperial kitabkhana** the center of production. Muhammad Husayn of Kashmir was one of the finest calligraphers at Akbar's court. Miniature paintings in the manuscripts was source of tension bw rulers and ulamas who invoked **Islamic prohibition of portrayal of human beings** (Quran, hadis) by Prophet. He forbade depiction of living beings in naturalistic manner as it would suggest that artist was **seeking to appropriate power of creation**. //Painters such as **Bihzad** contributed to cultural fame of Safavid court. Mir Sayyid Ali and Abdus Sammad were painters who came to India with Humayun.
        3. **Badshah Nama** by **Abdul Hamid Lahori** was **Shah Jahan'**s chronicle. Asiatic Society of Bengal was founded by William Jones in 1784 to edit, print and translate many Indian manuscripts. Badshah Nama hasn't been translated fully yet. Akbar Nama was translated by Henry Beveridge. **Alamgir** (Aurangzeb) by **Muhammad Kazim**.
        4. Divine light (**farri-i-izadi**) - **source of power of Mughals**, inspired by philosophy of Iranian sufi **Suhrawadi**. King becomes the **source of spiritual guidance** for his subjects. Idea of **sulh-i-kul** (absolute peace) prevailed, which meant freedom of expression as long as long **state authority not undermined** or fight amongst themselves. Akbar **abolished** tax on pilgrimage and **jizya** (re-imposed by Aurangzeb). Just sovereignty was a **social contract**, justice was represented through symbols in paintings (lion and cow together symbolized strong and weak in harmony). #important
        5. Capitals - Mughals had capitals at Agra, Sikri, Lahore, Delhi (Shahjahanabad). **Kornish** - Mughal aadab. Axis mundi - pole that is visualized as support of earth. **Chahar taslim & Zaminbos** - mode of salutation introduced by **Shah Jahan**. Titles could be earned or paid for by nobles. Imperial household - it was through alliances of marriages Mughals could keep together such a vast empire. Begams (royal wives) > **aghas** (non-noble wives) > **agachas** (concubines). **Humayun Nama was written by Gulbadan Begum** (described role of elderly women in resolving family conflicts).
        6. Imperial officials - mansabdars of **1000 above zat** were **umara** (nobles). Akbar designed the mansab system. Akbar had 3 ministers - mir bakshi (**paymaster**), diwan-i-ala (**finance**), sadr-us sudur (**grants**) - as advisory body. Akhbarat were court proceeding documents. Imperial post had foot runners (**qasid or pathmar**). Provincial governor was **subadar**. Suba was divided into sarkar which was divided into parganas.
        7. Beyond the empire - Hindukush had to be crossed by any intruder coming into India from NW. **Kabul and Kandahar were strategic outposts** to dispel any invasion. Kandahar was bone of contention bw Safavids and Mughals. Ottomans - trade and commerce plus pilgrim to Mecca relations. Jesuits - Monserrate & Acquaviva was member of first Jesuit mission.
10. Class 12 part 3
    
    1. Colonialism and countryside
        
        1. **Jotedar** was a rich class of peasants who had acquired vast lands. Controlled local trade and moneylending. Resisted zamindars on most issues and had effective control over a village. Zamindar's power were similar to a Collector before they were curtailed. Jotedars used to deliberately delay payment of revenue to zamindar and purchase their estates upon auction. Their rise weakened zamindari authority. Also known as haoldar, gantidars or mandals.
        2. Zamindars began benami transactions when estate was being auctioned. Even if it was sold to another zamindar, lathyal will not let it happen.
        3. **Fifth Report** - **document prepared by a Select Committee set up in 1810** by the British Parliament to look into the **affairs of the Company.** Terms of reference of the Select Committee were to inquire into the **state of the company's territorial possessions** with particular **focus on revenue and judiciary.** #important
        4. Hill people - as settled agriculture expanded, conflicts arose. **Santhals were the pioneer settlers and were persuaded to settle in Rajmahal hill area**. Area of land given to them was **Damin-i-koh.** But transactions with dikus (moneylenders, zamindars) made them more miserable. After Santhal revolt of 1855-56, Santhal Pargana was created from Bhagalpur and Birbhum.
        5. Francis Buchanan was a physician who was surgeon for Wellesley. His assessment was shaped by commercial concerns of company and western notions of progress.
        6. Bombay Deccan - revolt due to ryotwari system which was inspired by **David Ricardo** (economist). Under this, revenue was directly settled with ryot, land surveyed every 30 years. Revenue demand was so high that peasants fled villages. When someone failed to pay, crop was seized and fine imposed on whole villages.
        7. American Civil War made India top exporter of cotton to Britain, easy credit flowed and long term loans extended. This ended after supplies from America were revived post Civil War. Now ryots found it even harder to get loans and moneylenders were insensitive to their plight. Deeds and bonds became symbols of new oppressive system.
        8. **Deccan Riots Commission** - report presented to British Parliament in 1878. Rioters' specific purpose was to obtain and destroy the bonds, decrees, and other documents in the possession of the moneylenders (Pune et al 1875). Cultivators' distress resulted from falling agricultural prices, heavy taxation, and a sense of political powerlessness. Commercialization of agriculture under British land revenue policies burdened small peasants by placing a premium on access to credit to finance productive investments in the land.
    2. Rebels and the Raj
        
        1. In context of revolt of 1857, term revolt refers primarily to uprising of civilian population while mutiny was of the sepoys. To fight the British the rebels turned to old leaders. BSZ reluctantly became the nominal leader of the rebellion. Nana Saheb for Kanpur, Laxmi Bai for Jhansi, Kunwar Singh in Arah, Birjis Qadr (son of Waji Ali Shah) in Awadh. Local leaders emerged urging peasants, zamindars and tribals to revolt. Shah Mal and Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah inspired people to end firangi raj.
        2. Rumors and prophecies played a significant role in stirring people to action against British. (i) cartridges covered in cow and pig fat (ii) bone dust of cow and pig in flour of cantonments and cows (iii) 100 years since Battle of Plassey prophecy of end of British rule. Why did people believe the rumors?
            
            1. British adopted several reform policies - set up English medium schools, colleges and universities
            2. Laws to abolish sati and remarriage of Hindu widows
            3. Annexed new territories through Lapse and mis-governance takeover, and implemented new administration, laws and land revenue collection
            4. Activities of missionaries
            5. It seemed to people that all they held sacred - kings, socio-religious customs, pattern of landholding and revenue payment - was being destroyed and replaced with an alien and oppressive system.
        3. Awadh in revolt - Wajid Ali Shah was exiled to Calcutta on the plea of mis-governance but British wrongly assumed that he was unpopular. Removal of Nawab also led to dissolution of court and culture. British land revenue policy also undermined the position and authority of taluqdars. **Summary Settlement of 1856 in Awadh assumed talqudars were interlopers with no permanent stakes in land.** But revenue demand was over assessed and neither peasants nor taluqdars were happy. Ties of loyalty and patronage were broken as new system was inflexible in face of misfortune.
        4. What rebels wanted - vision of unity bw Hindu and Muslims against British, against oppression of zamindars, peasants, artisans, merchants, and against destruction of caste and religion of people.
        5. Repression - British passed a series of laws to help them quell the insurgency. Whole of north India was put under martial law, ordinary processes of law and trial were suspended and even ordinary Britons were given the power to try and punish Indians suspected of rebellion and reinforcements were brought in from Britain. Rebellion would have only one punishment: death. Campbell, Outram and Havelock were instrumental in suppressing the rebellion across North India, esp Lucknow.
    3. Colonial cities
        
        1. Madras, Calcutta and Bombay were all fishing and weaving villages, became trade centers due to trade of English EIC. Madras was settled in 1639, Bombay in 1661 (dowry from Holland).
        2. Before British - towns came to represent specific form of economic activities and cultures. Towns were populated by artisans, traders, administrators and rulers. Often fortified thus separating them from countryside.
            
            1. Presence of noblemen and emperor in towns led to development of services for their households. Focus of the town was oriented towards palace and mosque (temples in south). Kotwas oversaw internal affairs and policing of town.
            2. Gradual erosion of Mughal power led to demise of cities associated with their rule. **Qasbah** (small town with a local chief) and **Ganj** (small fixed market).
            3. European early towns - Panaji (Portuguese ), Masulipatnam (Dutch), Madras (British), Puducherry (French).
        3. Colonial cities - British created maps to allow better control over region. Survey of India was established in 1878**.** Census was **started in 1872** and then every 10 years from 1881, however census was riddled with incorrect information because of biases.
            
            1. Rise of metros was at the expense of other existing urban centers.
            2. Introduction of Railways led to de-urbanization of some cities (Mirzapur) and growth of new ones (Jamshedpur, Bareilly).
            3. M-C-B were not industrial cities by themselves but provided tertiary services. Only 2 can be classified as industrial - Kanpur (leather and textiles) and Jamshedpur (iron and steel).
            4. These cities reflected the mercantile culture of new rulers. Patronage shifted to merchants of EIC. Economic activity led to development of docks and ghats.
        4. After revolt, threat of natives led to segregation of spaces - Civil Lines came up in many cities. However mere segregation couldn't keep threat of diseases, which the black areas symbolized. Hence administrative measures regarding sanitation were implemented.
        5. Cantonments and hill stations were distinctive colonial urban development. Initially found and settling was based on need of British army. Hill stations were also developed as sanitariums where ill soldiers could be sent for recovering.
            
            1. Shimla because of Gurkha War
            2. Mount Abu because of Anglo Maratha War
            3. Darjeeling because of war with rulers of Sikkim.
        
        With plantations, influx of immigrant labor from plains meant hill stations were no longer exclusive racial enclaves.
        
        7. Company first set up trading at Surat, subsequently search for textiles got them to East coast - **Madraspatnam** in 1639. Local lords, **Nayaks of Kalahasti**, sold the rights of settlement.
        8. Madras - With defeat of French in 1761, Madras became more secure and grew. Fort St George became nucleus of White Town. Dutch and Portuguese were allowed because they were European and Christian. Initially jobs were monopolized by Vellalars. Brahmins started competing with spread of English education.
        9. Calcutta - grew from Sutanati, Kalikata and Govindapur.
            
            1. Wellesley in 1803 wrote Minutes on the need of urban planning which were mostly health related.
            2. Lottery Committee 1817 used to raise funds for town improvement through public lotteries and used to construct roads on Indian parts of Calcutta and clear river bank of encroachments.
            3. Govt believed that a direct correlation between diseases and living conditions existed. Densely built areas were seen as insanitary. Poor in the city were made to move frequently to distant part of the city strict regulations enforced (thatched roofs banned).
        
        With growth of their empire - town planning had to represent what British claimed to stand for: rational ordering, meticulous execution and western aesthetic ideals.
        
        11. Bombay - was initially 7 islands, fused to created one city. Indian middlemen made their wealth on opium export to China and cotton export to England. In 1869, Suez Canal was opened which opened up Europe to Asia even more. Bombay was declared Urbs Prima in Indis (most important city of India).
        12. British imported European style buildings - to feel home at alien land, to symbolize their superiority and to differentiate bw master and subjects. Architecture of public buildings - neo-classical (ancient Rome) example is Asiatic Society Bombay, neo-Gothic (mid-19th England) example is CST and finally Indo-Saracenic (Hindu-Muslim) example is Gateway of India.
    4. Gandhi and Nationalist Movement
        
        1. South Africa was making of Mahatma. First forged the non-violent protest of satyagraha, promoted harmony between religions. On **Gokhale's** advice, Gandhi traveled around British India and got to know people. 1st major public appearance was opening of BHU in 1916 - which was a statement that Indian nationalism was an elitist phenomenon - a creation of lawyers, doctors and landlords. Gandhi desired to make it more representative of Indian people as a whole.
        2. It was Rowlatt satyagraha that made Gandhi a national leader. This was followed up by NCM - renunciation of all voluntary association with British govt. Khilafat movement demanded the following - Khalifa to retain control over Muslim sacred places in erstwhile Ottoman empire, **jazirat-ul-Arab** (Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Palestine) must remain under Muslim sovereignty, and Khalifa to be left with sufficient territory to enable him to defend Islamic faith. Combining NCM and Khilafat unleashed a surge of popular action for the first time in colonial action.
        3. After NCM, movement was no longer that of professionals and intellectuals. Key aspect: Gandhi could be identified as a common folk. Gandhi appeared to Indian peasant as a savior - from high taxes and oppressive officials. While Gandhi's mass appeal was one aspect, broadening the basis of nationalism was based on careful organization
            
            1. New branches of Congress, Praja Mandals in princely states, communication of nationalist message in vernacular
            2. Industrial leaders were also supportive as they envisioned a free trade policy that will lead to growth.
        
        Gandhi was as much a social reformer as he was politician.
        
        5. Dandi March - covered with TN.
            
            1. 1st RTC in Nov 1931 was exercise in futility.
            2. Followed by Gandhi-Irwin pact - CDM called off, all prisoners released, salt mfg along sea coast. Criticized by radical nationalists as Gandhi unable to secure commitment of political independence
            3. 2nd RTC - Gandhi represents Congress but NOT all of India. Challenged by 3 parties - Muslim League (didn't represent minorities), Princely states (didn't represent their territories) and B.R. Ambedkar (didn't represent lowest castes). Conference **inconclusive**. Led to GOI Act 1935 => gave restricted franchise and Congress victory in 8/11 provinces.
        6. Once WW2 started, Congress offered some support towards the war given Hitler's agenda but on the promise that India will get full independence once war is over. Lord Linlithgow refused and talks broke down.
        7. In March 1940, Muslim League passed a resolution committing itself to creation of Pakistan. Now it was a 3 way struggle bw Congress, Muslim League and British. In 1942 Churchill sent Stafford Cripps to forge a compromise but talks failed. Congress had demanded to help if Viceroy appoints Indian as defense member of Executive Council.
        8. 1942 Quit India - genuinely a mass movement, esp energized the youth who left colleges and went to jail. During these years, Muslim League worked patiently at expanding their influence and made a mark in Punjab and Sindh. Gandhi released in 1944, who then held meetings with Jinnah seeking to bridge the gap. In 1945, Labor govt came to power and committed itself to granting independence.
        9. In 1946 provincial legislature election, Congress swept General seats while Muslim League dominated seats reserved for Muslims. Polarization was complete. Jinnah called for Direct Action Day on 16th Aug 1946, blood riots broke out.
        10. In Feb 1947, Mountbatten became the new Viceroy. Announced for independence and partition after a series of talks.
    5. Understanding Partition
        
        1. Boundaries bw India and Pakistan were not known for 2 days after formal independence. Partition generated memories, hatred, stereotypes and identities that still continue to shape history of people on either side of the border.
        2. Separate electorate crucially shaped the nature of communal politics (in 1909 & 1919). Religious identities acquired a functional use within modern political system. In 1937, elections to provincial legislatures were held for the first time. Only10-12% of people were eligible to vote. Congress won 5/11 and formed govt in 7/11. Refusal by Congress (who won absolute majority) of League's proposal of forming joint govt in UP further pushed League towards partition solution. Congress couldn't reach out to the Muslim masses and alarmed landed elite joined Muslim League as Congress pushed land reform agenda.
        3. Pakistan demand was formalized gradually. Pak-stan was coined by Choudhary Rehmat Ali in pamphlets in 1933 & 1935 and was not taken seriously initially. On 23 March 1940, resolution demanding autonomy in Muslim-majority areas was moved. League wished for a confederation of loosely structured states. Initially even Muslim leaders may have used it as a bargaining counter and gain additional favors.
        4. Discussions about transfer of power broke down **when League demanded right to choose all Muslim members of Executive Council** and **communal veto** of some sort (2/3 majority for decisions opposed by Muslims). Provincial elections held in 1946 gave sweeping victories to both Congress and ML in their respective electorates. In March 1946, 3 member Cabinet Mission was sent to suggest suitable political framework for Free India. 3 tier confederation was recommended - weak central govt controlling only foreign affairs, communications and defense. States to be reorganized as State A (Hindu majority) and State B Muslim majority in NW and State C Muslim majority in NE.
        5. Initially plan was accepted but due to differing interpretations. League wanted grouping to be compulsory with right to secede in future. Congress wanted provinces be given the right to join a group. This was a crucial juncture because after this partition became, tragically, inevitable. Pakistan announced 16 Aug 1946 as "Direct Action Day". Riots broke and violence spread to many parts of northern India. Congress high command in March 1947 also voted for split as numerical minority and loss of political power in either Punjab or Bengal would have been an unacceptable outcome.
        6. Bloodbath continued for a year from March 1947 onwards. Main reason for this was collapse of governance. British were preparing to leave India, Indian civil servants feared for their own lives and property and Indian leadership was busy negotiating independence. Displacement of Hindus and Muslims happened bw 1946 and 1948. Punjab was the worst affected. Muslim families from interior India continued to migrate through 50s and 60s (known as **muhajirs** or migrants).
    6. Framing the Constitution
        
        1. At independence, India was not only large and diverse but also deeply divided. Constitution sought to heal the wounds of past and present and make diverse Indians come together in shared political experiment.
        2. Great Calcutta Killings of Aug 1946 began a year of almost continuous rioting across northern and eastern India. Millions of refugees were on the move. Constitutional status of princely states was ambiguous. Constituent Assembly met in the background of these issues.
        3. Members of this Assembly were not elected on the basis of universal franchise. In winter of 1945-46, provincial elections were held. They then chose representatives to Constituent Assembly. 82% of its members were from Congress as League boycotted it and Socialists also stayed away. Through the national movement Congress members had learnt to debate their ideas in public and negotiate their differences. Public was also asked to send in their views to create sense of collective participation. Dominant voices - Nehru, Patel, Prasad, Ambedkar, K.M. Munshi, Alladi Krishnaswamy Aiyar. Two civil servants - B.N. Rau - constitutional advisor to govt. S.N. Mukherjee - Chief Draughtsman.
        4. Nehru introduced Objectives Resolution in Dec 1946, outlining the ideals of Constitution and provided framework within which work of making it was to proceed. Proclaimed India to be "independent sovereign republic" guaranteeing its citizens justice, equality and freedom, assuring safeguards for minorities, backward and tribal areas. No specific form of democracy was defined and suggested that this had to be decided through deliberations.
        5. Separate electorates was a topic of intense and passionate debates. Many thought it was possible for people to live in harmony only if minorities were well represented within the political system and their views taken into account. Even more people contended that it was a suicidal demand that would permanently isolate the minorities and lead to divided loyalties and against the idea of a unified nation. **After partition, Ambedkar too no longer argued for separate electorates.**
        6. Before partition, Congress had agreed to grant considerable autonomy to provinces. After partition, most nationalists changed their positions as earlier pressures for a loose federation structure were not there. Violence of the time gave push to centralization - to plan for country's economic development and to forestall chaos.
        7. Language - in 1930s Congress had accepted that Hindustani ought to be the national language. This multi cultural language would be ideal for communication bw diverse communities. However as communal conflicts deepened, Hindi and Urdu started growing apart. Hindi was Sanskritized and Urdu was Persianized. Languages became associated with politics of religious identities. **R.V. Dhulekar** pushed for Hindi becoming National Language of India.
