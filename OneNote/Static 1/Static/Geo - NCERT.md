2. **Class 6**
    
    1. Celestial bodies - what are they? Celestial bodies made up of gases with own light and heat are stars. Celestial bodies lit by light of other stars are planets. We get out light and heat from the sun.
    2. Inner planets made up of rocks - till Mars /asteroid belt. Jupiter to Neptune - huge planets made up of gases and liquids. **Jupiter has 69 moons (highest)**
    3. Sun - provides pulling force that binds solar system. Sun- Earth distance 150 million km. International Astronomical Union - Pluto, Ceres, UB313 - classified them as dwarf planets.
    4. Earth - shape of geoid. Moon - diameter 1/4 of earth. 384k km away, moon orbit time - **27 days, spin time also same** => **only one side of the moon is visible to us** (far side of the moon). USA Russia Japan India China all have had probe landing on moon. Asteroid belt - part of a planet that exploded.
    5. Galaxy - huge system of billions of stars, clouds of dust and gases.
    6. Latitudes - equator represents zero latitude. Equator to poles measure 1/4 of 360=90 degrees. Tropic of Cancer 23 1/2 degrees. Arctic circle 66 1/2 degrees. Size of parallel decreases as we approach the poles.
    7. Torrid zone (Tropics) - mid day sun exactly overhead at least once a year on all latitudes bw Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn. Mid day sun never shines overhead on any latitude beyond that. Angle of sun's ray goes on decreasing towards the poles. Tropic of Cancer/Capricorn and Arctic Circle/Antarctic Circle have temperate climate - Temperate Zone. From there to poles - Frigid Zone
    8. Longitudes - Lines of reference called meridians of longitudes. Distance bw them decreases steadily towards poles, at poles it is zero. All longitudes of equal length. Starts at Greenwich (why - British Royal Observatory) - prime meridian. 1 degree = 4 mins. IST - 82 1/2 degrees. Russia has 11 time zones, earth has 24 (15 degrees = 1 time zone). All longitudes have mid day at the same time.
    9. Rotation - movement of earth on its axis. Axis of earth, an imaginary line, makes angle of 66 1/2 with its orbital plane (plane formed by orbit). The circle that divides day from night (vertically) is called circle of illumination. If no rotation, one side always hot one side always freezing cold. Takes 24 hours.
    10. Revolution - around the sun in a fixed path. Takes 365 1/4 days. Earth goes around in an elliptical orbit. Summer solstice 21 June - north hemisphere tilted towards sun => rays directly on Tropic of Cancer. Summer in north hemisphere. Longest day and shortest night. Everything reverse in south hemisphere.

    12. Components of map - distance, direction and symbol. Scale is ratio bw actual distance and distance on map. Four major directions - cardinal points
    13. Components of environment - lithosphere (land), atmosphere (gaseous layer), hydrosphere (water). Biosphere - narrow zone where all together contains all forms of life. Lithosphere - continents and continental basins. Bachendri Pal - first Indian woman to climb Everest 1984. Isthmus - narrow strip of land joining two land masses
    14. Hydrosphere - 97.2% oceans, 2.8% water - 0.03% fresh water, 2.77% ice sheets and ground water. Pacific is **largest 1/3 of earth, almost circular.** Atlantic - indented coastline, **ideal for natural harbours and ports -** busiest ocean.
    15. Atmosphere - **extends up to 1600 km**. Divided into 5 layers based on composition, temperature, etc. Atmosphere - 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 1% others (Argon is 0.93%, CO2 is 0.03%, balance). Carbon dioxide - important for it absorbs heat radiated by Earth => planet warm. Density maximum at sea level and decreases as we go up. Air moves from high pressure to low pressure, moving air is known as wind.
    
    Biosphere - organisms in biosphere divided into plant and animal kingdom.
    
    17. Landforms - result of two processes - internal and external. Internal - leads to upliftment and sinking of earth's surface. External - continuous wearing down and rebuilding of land surface. Erosion (wearing away of surface), deposition (rebuilt process). Both happen by way of running water, ice and wind.
    18. Mountains - natural elevation of earth surface. Glacier - frozen river of ice in mountains. Mountains arranged in a line are a range. Three types of mountains - (1) Block - created when large areas are broken and **displaced vertically.** Uplifted blocks are called **horsts and lowered blocks are grabe****n**. E.g. Rhine Valley, Vosges. (2) volcanic - formed due to **volcanic activity. E.g. Kilimanjaro, Fujiyama**. (3) Fold - formed by **folding of earth's crust.** E.g. Aravali (old), Himalayas and Alps (new), Rockies, Andes. Plateaus - rich in mineral deposits. African plateau - gold and diamond. Chhotanagpur - iron, coal, manganese. **Gondwana rocks have coal formation. Archean system covers 2/3 of Indian peninsula.**
    
    Plains - **not more than 200m** above sea level. Formed by rivers and their tributaries, flowing down the slopes of mountains and eroding them. Deposit the load (sand, silt, stones) along their courses. These deposits form plains.
    
    20. India -3.28m sq km. **Kashmir to Kanyakumari 3200 km**. Arunachal to Kutch 2900 km. Latitudes - 8•4'N to 37•6'N. longitudes - 68•7'E to 97•25'E. Indian standard time - 82•30'E near Allahabad. **Longest land border with Bangladesh,** land border with 7 nations including **Afghanistan (100 km in Wakhan Corridor)** Himalayan mountains - great Himalaya or Himadri, middle Himalaya or Himachal, Shivalik. Plains - formed by alluvial deposits of Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra (and their tributaries). Peninsular plateau - Aravali on north west, Vindhayas and Satpuras in north (Narmada and Tapi flowing through - west flowing). Western Ghats/ Sahyadri in west, Eastern Ghats provide east boundary. Coastal plains - west is narrow, east are much broader. East flowing river - Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri. Corals are skeletons of polyps - other polyps grow on top of hard skeleton thus forming coral islands.
    21. Major recognised seasons in India - **cold, hot, southwest monsoon and retreating** monsoon. Climate is average weather conditions measured over many years. India climate - **monsoon type.** Climate affected by - location, altitude, distance from the sea and relief.
    22. Vegetation of India - 5 types. (1) tropical rain forest - heavy rainfall areas. So dense that **sunlight doesn't reach ground**. Trees shed leaves at **different times** of year. Therefore always **green and called evergreen** forests. E.g. **Mahogany, ebony and rosewood.** In India - A&NI, parts of NE states and narrow strip of western slope of Western ghats. (2) Tropical deciduous forests - monsoon forests. Less dense and shed leaves during particular time of year. E.g. **Sal, peepul, neem and sheesham**. In India - MP, UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and parts of Maha. (3) Thorny bushes - in **dry areas** of country. Leaves in **form is spines** to reduce loss of water. E.g**.

3. Class 7
    
    1. Environment is our basic life support system, provides air we breath, water we drink, food we eat and land where we live. It is combination of natural and human made phenomena. Natural environment is both biotic and abiotic conditions, human environment reveals activities, creations and interactions among human beings. ￼Natural environment - Lithosphere is **solid crust of the earth**, made up of **rocks and minerals** and covered by thin layer of soil. **Irregular surface** with landforms, found over continents and ocean floors. Hydrosphere - domain of water, comprises various source of water and different types of water bodies, essential for ALL living organisms. Atmosphere - thin layer of air that surrounds the earth. **Gravitational force of earth holds the atmosphere around it.** Protects us from harmful rays and scorching heat of sun. Changes in atmosphere produces changes in weather and climate. Biosphere - narrow zone of earth where land, water and air interact with each other to support life. ￼Ecosystem - system formed by **interaction of all living organisms with each other** and with physical and chemical factors of environment in which they live, all linked by transfer of energy and material.￼Human Environment - human beings interact and modify it according to our needs.
    2. Interior of our earth￼Crust - thinnest of all layers, **35 km on continental masses and 5 km on ocean floors.** Main mineral constituents of continental mass are **silica and alumina (called sial / felsic,** 2.7 times denser than water). For oceanic crust - **silica and magnesium (sima / mafic**, 3.4 times denser than water). Oceanic is thinner, denser and younger than continental crust. Continental crust is predominantly granitic rock (see granite), while composition of the **oceanic crust corr****esponds mainly to that of basalt**. Crust consists of **mainly igneous rocks**, and **sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.** ￼Mantle - 100-2900 km thick. Composed of **silicate material** ￼Core - 2900-5100-6370 km thick. Made up **nickel and iron**, very high temperature and pressure. **Inner core is rotating** and **cause of earth's magnetic field.** ￼Crust forms 1% volume of earth, **84% is mantle** and **15% core**. Radius of earth 6371 km. ￼Rocks and minerals - any natural mass of mineral matter that makes up earth's crust is called a rock. 3 major types ￼Igneous - when **molten magma cools, it becomes solid** and thus formed rocks are called igneous rocks (also called primary rocks). 2 types - **intrusive rocks (when molten lava cools down slowly deep** inside earth's surface, **large grain**, eg **granite**) and **extrusive rocks (when molten lava cools down rapidly** after coming on earth's surface, **fine grained structures**, eg **basalt**). ￼Sedimentary - Rocks broken down into **small fragments, transported and compressed** and hardened to form layers of rocks are called sedimentary rocks. Eg **sandstone** (made from grains of sand). May contain **fossils of plants/animals.** ￼Metamorphic - igneous and sedimentary rocks can change into metamorphic rocks under great heat and pressure. **Eg clay changes into slate and limestone into marble.** ￼Rock cycle -
    3.   
        
    4. Our changing earth￼Lithosphere is broken into a **number of plates known as lithospheric plates** which move around **very slowly -** few mm each year - cos of **movement of molten magma**. Earth movements are divided on the basis of forces which cause them -
        
        1. **Endogenic forces** (i) Sudden forces eg earthquake, volcano, landslide (ii) Diastrophic forces eg building mountains
        2. **Exogenic forces** - erosional and depositional such as river, wind, sea waves, glaciers
    
    Earthquake - when lithospheric plates move, **surface of earth vibrates: the vibrations are called earthquake**. Focus - **place in crust where movement starts.** Epicenter - **place on the surface above** the focus. Types of earthquake waves -
    
    1. Primary waves or longitudinal waves - **push and pull waves, resemble sound waves.** Travel outward from point of disturbance in **all directions in straight lines. Fastest** of all earthquake waves**. P and S waves cause the rocking motion of the earth.**
    2. Secondary/shear waves or transverse waves
    3. L waves or surface waves (love and rayleigh)
    
    Earthquake measured with **seismograph**, magnitude of earthquake is measured on **Richter scale** (measured in **logarithmic scale**, 3.0 to 4.0 is 10x).￼Major land forms - landscape is being continuously worn away by 2 processes - **weathering and erosion.** Weathering is the breaking up of **rocks on earth's surface**. Erosion is wearing away of the landscape by **different agents**. These 2 processes created different landforms on surface of earth. ￼Rivers - twists and turns forming **large bends are called meanders**. When meander loop cut off from the river and forms a cut off lake, its called an **ox bow lake.** Floodplains - formed by overflowing rivers depositing layers of fine soil and sediments. The **raised banks are called levees**. As it approaches seas and begins to break up into distributaries which has own mouth, the **collection of sediments from all the mouths forms a delta.** ￼Sea waves - erosion and deposition of sea waves gives rise to **coastal landforms.** Sea caves, sea arch, stack (only wall after roof of arch is gone). Sea waves **deposit sediments along the shores forming beaches**. ￼Ice - glaciers are river of ice which erode the landscape by **bulldozing soil and stones to expose the solid rock** below. Glacial moraines - **material deposits carried by the glacier.**  
    Wind - mushroom rocks (narrow base, wider top). Wind causing **low hill structures are called sand dunes. Loess - deposits of grains of sand (fine and light)** carried over by wind over long distances (eg China).
    
    8. Air - carbon dioxide in the atmosphere creates a green house effect by trapping the heat radiated from the earth - called greenhouse gas and without it earth would have been too cold to live in. But when heat retained increases (due to human activity), the temperature of the earth goes up = global warming. Snow melts -> sea level rises -> floods in coastal areas. ￼Plants cannot take nitrogen (needed for survival) directly from air. Bacteria that live in the soil and roots of some plants take nitrogen from air and change its form so that plants can use. Green plants produce oxygen during photosynthesis, use carbon dioxide to make food and release oxygen. Plants CO2 in = humans CO2 out. ￼Atmosphere - 5 layers
        
        1. **Troposphere** - most imp layers, **height 13 km.** the air we breathe exists here. **Most weather phenomena** occur in this layer
        2. **Stratosphere** - 13-50 km. Almost **free from clouds** and associated weather phenomenon, **ideal for airplanes.** Contains layer of **ozone gas.**
        3. **Mesosphere** - 50-80 km. **Meteorites** burn up in this layer upon entering from space.
        4. **Thermosphere** - 80-100 km. Temperature **rises very rapidly** with increasing height. **Ionosphere** (80-1000 km) part of this layer. Ionosphere is i**onized by solar and cosmic radiation:** atoms have been stripped of one or more electrons and are **positively charged.** This layer helps in **radio transmission** (transmitted from earth and reflected back to earth)
        5. Exosphere - upper most layer of atmosphere, **very thin air.** Light gases like **helium and hydrogen float into space from here**. Earth receives **1/200b parts of sun's energy.**

Dead Sea in Israel has 340g/kg of water. **Rivers have the least amount of fresh water.** 75% of fresh water is in ice caps. 22 March World Water Day.￼Ocean circulation - movements that occur in oceans can be categorized as
        
        1. Waves - formed when **winds scrape across the ocean surface**: stronger the wind blows, the bigger the wave becomes. First indication of tsunami is **rapid withdrawal of water from coastal region** (as water displacement happens to fill in displacement between continental plates), followed by destructive wave
        2. Tides - rhythmic **rise and fall of ocean water twice in a day.** High tide when water **covers much of the shore** by rising to highest level, low tide when water falls to lowest level and **recedes from the shore.** Why - strong gravitational pull **exerted by the sun and moon on the earth's surface** causes the tides. High tide - caused by gravitational force of **moon**. During full moon and new moon - sun, moon, earth in same line and tides are **highest (spring tides)**. First and last quarter of moon, diagonal pull from both sun and moon results in **lowest tides (neap tides)**. High tide - useful in navigation, fishing.
        3. Currents - streams of water flowing constantly on the ocean surface in definite directions, can be cold or warm. Generally **warm ocean currents originate near equator** and move towards the pole. Ocean **current influences the temperature conditions** of the area. Areas where warm + cold current meet = **best fishing grounds in the world + foggy weather difficult in navigation.**

Fresh water - Wular Lake (tectonic activity), Dal Bhimtal Nainital Loktak and Barapani (MG, Umiam dam) are some other. **Guru Gobind Sagar (Bhakra Nangal,** dam lake).
    6. Climate - word mausim means season = **Monsoon**, refers to **seasonal reversal in wind direction** during a year. **Climate of India is monsoon type**. Variation in rainfall patterns gives rise to variety in lives of people. Factors affecting climate -
        
        1. Latitude - **amount of solar energy received** varies according to latitude. India's climate has characteristics of **tropical and sub-tropical.**
        2. Altitude - Himalayas prevent cold winds from Central Asia from entering subcontinent, hence **mild winter compared to Central Asia.**
        3. Pressure and winds - **surface winds, upper air circulation, western cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclone**. India lies in the region of **north easterly winds**, which originate from **subtropical high pressure belt of northern hemisphere**. Blow south, get deflected **right to due to coriolis force** and move on towards equatorial low pressure area. Carry very **little moisture.**
            
            1. Coriolis force - apparent force caused by **earth's rotation,** responsible for deflecting wind towards **right in NH and towards left in SH**. Also known as **Ferrel's law**.
            2. During winter, there's a high pressure area north of Himalayas, wind blows from here to low **pressure over oceans (south), north east winds.**￼During summer, low pressure area over **interior Asia and NW India,** complete reversal of winds. Air moves from high pressure area over southern Indian ocean, in **SE direction, crosses equator get deflected to right** and moves towards low pressure area over subcontinent. These are the South West Monsoon winds.
            3. **Upper air circulation** in this region is dominated by **westerly flow,** important component of flow is jet stream. **Jet streams** are located approx. 27-30 N latitude (known as **subtropical westerly jet stream**). They blow over **south of Himalayas throughout year** **except summer**. Western **cyclonic disturbances** experienced in North and NW India are brought by this westerly flow. In summer, subtropical westerly jet stream moves **north of Himalayas with apparent movement of sun.** Sub tropical **easterly jet stream blows over peninsular** land in summer (approx. 14 N). #important
            4. Western cyclonic disturbances - phenomena of **winter months,** brought by westerly flow from **Mediterranean region.** Influence weather of north and north western region. Tropical cyclones occur during **monsoon and Oct-Nov and are part of** **easterly flow.**
        4. Indian monsoon - Arab traders named **seasonal reversal of wind system as monsoon**. Monsoons are experienced roughly bw **20 N and 20 S.** Mechanism of monsoon
            
            1. **Differential** heating and cooling of land and water creates **low pressure on landmass** of India while seas experience comparatively higher pressure.
            2. Shift of **position of ITCZ in summer, over Ganga plain.** This is **equatorial trough** normally positioned over 5N of equator. Known as monsoon trough during monsoon season. ITCZ is broad trough of low pressure in equatorial latitudes, where **northeast and southeast trade winds converge.** More or less parallel to equator but **moves with movement of sun.** #important
            3. High pressure area **east of Madagascar** - **intensity and position of this area** affects Indian monsoon.
            4. Tibetan plateau gets intensely heated during summer resulting in **strong vertical air currents and formation of low pressure over the plateau at 9 km sea level.**
            5. **Movement of westerly jet stream to north of Himalayas** and presence of tropical easterly jet stream over Indian peninsula. #important
            6. Southern oscillation - tropical east pacific ocean (Peru) experience **high** pressure, tropical east Indian Ocean experience **low** pressure. When reverse happens, Southern Oscillation. **Tahiti and Darwin** pressure are computed to predict intensity of monsoon. If pressure difference is **negative**, late and avg monsoon.
            7. El Nino, **warm** ocean current flowing past Peruvian coast **instead** of cold Peruvian current (every 2-5 years). Presence of El Nino leads to **increase** in sea-surface temperature and **weakening** of trade winds in the region. Known to **dry up monsoon rains** every six out of 10 years.
        5. Onset and withdrawal - monsoon are **not steady winds but pulsating** due to atmospheric conditions. Monsoon arrives at tip of Indian by **1st week June.** Branches into 2 - Arabian Sea (rapid, Mumbai in 10 days) and Bay of Bengal (also rapid, Assam), Mountains cause winds to deflect towards west over Ganga plains. **Both merge over Ganga plains** (around July beginning). Mid-July, all over the country.￼Withdrawal is gradual - by September beginning, mid-October-**early December completely withdraws** from Indian peninsula.
        6. Winter - NE wind (hence NE monsoon, from land to sea, except for TN). Inflow of **cyclonic disturbances from the west**. Low pressure system in Mediterranean and West Asia, **move to India along with the westerly**. Cause much needed **winter rains over plains and snowfall** in mountains. Rainfall is small (known as **mahawat**), important for rabi crops. #important
        7. Summer - due to shift of sun, global heat belt **shifts northward.** Elongated **low pressure area over Thar to Chotanagpur plateau causing loo.** Season for localized thunderstorms known as **kaal baishakhi**. Pre-monsoon showers common in Karnataka and Kerala, known as **mango showers.**
        8. Monsoon - Rainfall in Ganga valley **decreases from east to west. Maximum** amount of rainfall is received in **north east** of country. **Breaks** in monsoon are related to **movement of monsoon troughs** (trough and axis **keep moving north or south determining spatial** rainfall).
        9. Retreating monsoon - during October November, **movement of sun to south and low pressure** trough over northern plains **becomes weaker, gradually replaced** by high pressure system. October heat - high temperature and humidity. Low pressure conditions over NW India **get transferred to Bay of Bengal** by early Nov, shift is associated with occurrence of cyclonic depressions, which originate over Andaman Sea. Bulk of rainfall of **Coromandel Coast is derived from depressions and cyclones.**
        10. Distribution of rainfall - **400 cm in western and NE India**. 60 cm and less in Rajasthan and Gujarat. Same in interior Deccan and east of Sahayadris.
    7. Natural vegetation and wild life
        
        1. India has 47,000 plant species and 90,000 animal 2,000 birds and 2,500 fish species. Natural vegetation which grows **without human aid and left undisturbed by humans**, aka virgin vegetation. India's forest cover is **21.5% of total geographical area**, Lakshadweep is highest, **Haryana lowest.**
        2. Gujjar-Bakarwal is nomadic tribe in **montane forests.** Deltas of Ganga, Mahanadi, Krishna, Godavari and Kaveri (all east coast) hare covered by mangroves. India is **only** country in world which has both **lions and tigers.**
    8. Population
        
        1. Census - first census was **held in 1872,** first **complete census in 1881.** India has 1.3 billion people (17% of world), 382 density, life expectancy of **69 years,** fertility rate of 2.2, **IMR 34 per 1000, MMR 167 per 100,000.** Population growth rate of **1.2%** (slightly higher than world, China 0.5%)
        2. Literacy - a person aged **7 years and above** who can read and write **with understanding** in **any** language is literate.

7. Class 11
    
    1. Geography as a discipline
        
        1. Natural means of subsistence are - edible plants and animals. **Eratosthenese coined the word geography which means description of earth.** Concerned with study of nature and human interactions as an integrated whole. Tech has helped in reducing the harshness of labor, increased efficiency and provided leisure to human beings.
        2. Geography concerned with 3 sets of questions - what (patterns of features), where (distribution of features) and why (causal relationship bw features => geo as a science)? Geography is a discipline of (spatial) synthesis. World is a system of interdependencies. What is the relationship bw history and geography? Geography and natural and social sciences?
        3. Branches of Geography - Systematic approach was given by Humboldt. Phenomenon studied world over as a whole.
            
            1. Physical - geomorphology, climatology, hydrology, soil geography.
            2. Human - social/cultural, population and settlement, economic, historical, political,
            3. Bio-geography is interface bw physical geography and human geography - plant, zoo, ecology, environmental geography.
        4. Branches of Geography - Regional by Ritter. Geographical phenomena in a region ae studied.
            
            1. Regional studies - macro, meso and micro
            2. Regional planning - rural and urban
            3. Regional development
            4. Regional analysis
        5. 2 aspects common:
            
            1. Philosophy - geographical thought, land and human ecology
            2. Methods and Techniques - Cartography, quantitative techniques, field survey methods, Geo Informatics
    2. Origin and evolution of Earth
        
        1. Origin of earth - **Nebular Hypothesis by Kant-Laplace**. Planets formed out of **cloud of material** associated with **slowly rotating sun**. Chamberlain-Moulton - **wandering sun made solar material separate from sun's surface**; which condensed into planets over time. Binary theories - there's a **companion** to the sun.
        2. Origin of universe - big bang theory or **expanding universe hypothesis**_,_ evidence by **Edwin Hubble**. **Space bw galaxies is increasing but not galaxies themselves (initial singularity).** ￼In the center of a black hole is a gravitational **singularity**, a **one-dimensional point which contains a huge mass in an infinitely small space,** where **density and gravity become infinite** and space-time curves infinitely, and where the laws of physics as we know them cease to operate.
        3. Big Bang stages -
            
            1. Singular atom with **unimaginably small volume, infinite temperature and infinite density.**
            2. At Big Bang violent and huge explosion. **13.7 billion years ago**. First atom formed **within 3 minutes** of Big Bang
            3. Within 300,000 years from BB, temperature drops to 4500 K and gave rise to atomic matter, **universe becomes transparent.**
        4. Star formation - distribution of matter & energy **not even** in early universe -> **differences in gravitational forces** which caused matter to get drawn together -> basis for development of galaxies. A **galaxy starts to form by accumulation of hydrogen gas** in the form of **very large cloud called nebula.** Eventually nebula develops localized clumps of gas which grows into even denser gaseous bodies //**Light year is measure of distance** and not of time. Sun to earth is 8.3 light year minutes.
        5. Planet formation - stars are **localized lumps of gas within a nebula**. Gravitational force within lumps leads to **formation of a core to the gas cloud.** Gas clouds condense and **matter around core develops into small-rounded objects** called planetesimals. Large bodies start forming by **collision and gravitational attraction** causes material to stick together. Large number of **small planetesimals accrete** to form planets
        6. Solar system - Nebula collapsed and **core formed 5.5 billion years ago** and planets formed **4.5 billion years ago**. Sun, 8 planets, 63 moons, millions of smaller bodies, huge quantity of dust-grains and gases. Mercury to Mars (inner planets, **made of rock or metals or terrestrial**, **have high densities**) <asteroid belt> Jupiter to Neptune (outer, **made of gases or Jovian** which means Jupiter like). Some facts
            
            1. **Saturn has the least density**, **Earth is most dense. Saturn will float on water.**
            2. Mercury and Venus have 0 satellites, Jup - 69 Sat - 62 Nep 14.
            3. Mercury < **Mars < Venus < Earth** < Neptune < Uranus < Saturn < Jupiter - on the basis of size
            4. **All four jovian planets are surrounded by a set of rings**. These rings are made up of rock, ice, and dust particles
        7. Terrestrial vs Jovian - (a) terrestrial formed in **close vicinity of parent star where too** **warm** **for gases** to condense to solid particles (b) **solar wind** **most intense** near the sun c) terrestrial planets are **smaller and lower gravity** couldn't hold escaping gases #important
        8. International Astronomical Union est 1919 Paris - international association of professional astronomers, recognized authority for **assigning designations on celestial bodies**. Member of International Council for Science - which is international organization for advancement of Science. **Indian National Science Academy** (1935) is member of ICSU.
        9. Moon - only natural satellite of earth. Moon formed from the **debris left over after a giant impact hypothesis** between Earth and a Mars-sized body called **Theia**.
        10. Earth - initially a barren, rocky and hot object with a **thin atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.**
        11. Evolution of lithosphere - due to gradual **increase in density**, the temperature inside has increased. Material started **getting separated depending on their densities**. Allowed heavier metals to sink towards center of earth and lighter to one move towards the surface. From **crust to core, density of material increases.**
        12. Evolution of atmosphere - stages: **loss of primordial** atmosphere -> **hot interior of earth** contributed to evolution of atmosphere -> composition **modified by living world** through process of photosynthesis. ￼Early atmosphere with **hydrogen and helium stripped off as a result of solar winds**. During cooling of earth -> **gases & water vapor were released from the interior solid earth** -> evolution of present atmosphere. Process by which gases were **outpoured from interior is called degassing**.
        13. Hydrosphere - Continuous **volcanic eruptions contributed water vapor and gases** to the atmosphere. As earth cooled, **water vapor released** started getting condensed. **CO2 in air got dissolved in rain water and temperature further decreased** causing more condensation and more rains. **Rainwater in depressions => oceans, formed within 500 million years**. Life confined to **oceans for about 1-1.5 billion years.** Oceans began to **create oxygen through photosynthesis, got saturated, flooded the atmosphere.**
        14. Origin of life - Mammals came in **Mesozoic** Era (65-245 million) consists of **Cretaceous** (65-144, extinction of dinos), **Jurassic** (144-208, age of dinos), (208-245, frogs and turtles).￼**Cainozoic** (0-65 million years) Epochs - **Holocene** (0-10k - Modern Man), **Pleistocene** (10k - 2m, homo sapiens).
    3. Interior of the earth
        
        1. Configuration of surface of earth is largely a **product of processes operating in interior** of the earth. **Exogenic and endogenic processes** **are constantly shaping the landscape**. Earth forming materials have been distributed from **crust to the core**. Most of our knowledge about interior of earth is based on estimates and inferences. Earth's circumference at **40,000 km, longer equatorial than polar because of centrifugal force**. Radius is 6371 km.
        2. Direct sources - rocks from **mining areas**/surface. **Volcanic eruptions.**
        3. Indirect sources - **Temperature and pressure** increase with the increasing distance from the surface towards the interior in (density of material also increases) deeper depths.
            
            1. The **poles are closer to the center of the Earth due to the equatorial bulge**. This strengthens gravitation at the poles and weakens it at the equator.
        4. Gravity anomaly - difference between the **locally observed and the theoretically calculated** value of gravity that reflects local variations. They give us information about **distribution of mass of material** in the crust of the earth.￼Magnetic surveys - also provide info about the **distribution of magnetic materials in crustal portion**. ￼Seismic - through earthquakes et al
        5. Earthquake - Study of **seismic waves** provide a complete picture of the layered interior. Earthquakes occur due to **release of energy along a fault line.** A fault is **sharp break in crustal rocks, which tend to move in opposite directions**. Overlying **rock strata presses them and friction locks** them together. Eventually friction is overcome and this causes a release of energy. **Point where energy is released is called focus/hypocenter. The point on the surface, nearest to focus is, called epicenter.** First one to experience the wave.
        6. **All natural earthquakes take place in lithosphere**. Lithosphere - depth up to **200 km from surface**. Seismograph records the waves reaching the surface. Waves are of 2 types - **body waves (p & s) and surface waves.** #important
            
            1. Body waves - generated due to release of energy at the focus and **move in** **all directions** traveling through the body of the earth. Body waves interact with surface rocks and **generate new set of waves** **called surface waves**. **Denser the material, higher the velocity of the wave**. Direction also changes.
                
                1. Primary waves - **move faster and first to arrive at surface**. Are similar to sound waves. Travel through **gaseous, liquid and solid materials.**
                2. Secondary waves - can travel **through only solid** materials (as no shear strength in liquids). Reflection causes waves to rebound whereas refraction makes waves move in different direction.
            2. Surface waves - **last to report on seismograph, most destructive** as they cause displacement of rocks.
        7. Propagation of earthquake waves - travel in different manners, cause vibration in the body of rocks.
            
            1. P waves vibrate **parallel to direction of the wave;** exerts pressure and creates density differences in material leading to **stretching and squeezing.**
            2. Other 2 waves - **perpendicular to wave direction**. S waves - perpendicular to wave direction in vertical plane; which **creates troughs and crests** in the material through which they pass.
            3. **Surface waves** propagate only at the **interface between two different media,** like the interface between Earth and atmosphere (i.e. the surface of the Earth).
        8. Shadow zone - where the **waves are not reported by seismograph.**
        9. ![Image result for shadow zone of p waves](Exported%20image%2020250424103315-0.png)
        
        S wave - entire zone beyond **103** doesn't receive. Larger shadow zone.  
        P wave - **103 to 142** shadow zone (for both P & S)
        
        11. Types of earthquakes - most common ones are
            
            1. **Tectonic** (generated due to sliding of rocks along a fault plane). Volcanic is **special class of tectonic.**
            2. **Collapse** - areas of intense **mining activity;** roofs of underground mines collapse, causing minor tremors.
            3. **Explosion** - ground shaking due to **explosion of chemical or nuclear** device.
            4. **Reservoir induced** - in areas of large reservoirs
        12. Measuring earthquakes - **Magnitude scale is** **Richter** **scale**. **Intensity scale is** **Mercalli****,** range 1-12 and takes into account visible damage.
        
        Tsunamis are waves **generated by the tremors** **and not the earthquake in itself.**
        
        14. Structure of earth -
            
            1. Crust - brittle, thickness varies. **Oceanic crust is 5 km, continental is 30 km. 70 km thick in Himalayas.** Ocean crust is made up of **heavier rocks having density 3g/cm3**. This rock in oceanic crust is **basalt**. Mean density of material in **continental crust is 2.7g/cm3.** Lithosphere = crust + upper most solid mantle.
            2. Mantle - beyond the crust. **Moho discontinuity is the boundary bw crust and the mantle.** Upper portion is called **asthenosphere**, astheno means weak. Extends up to 400km. Main **source of magma** that surfaces during volcanic eruptions. Density higher than crust 3.4g/cm3. **Lower mantle is in solid state.**
            3. Core - **Outer core is liquid while inner is solid**. Density at mantle core boundary 5g/cm3 **(Gutenberg discontinuity)** and at **core 13g/cm3.** Core made up of nife - nickel and iron.
        15. Volcanoes - place where **gases, ashes and molten rock material (lava) escapes to the surface**. Lava contains - **nitrogen & sulphur compounds**, plus little **chlorene, hydrogen and argon**.￼Types -
            
            1. Shield - **largest of all volcanoes** (barring basalt flows). Mostly **made up of basalt** (type of lava which is very fluid when erupted). Hence volcanoes **not steep.** Explosive if water gets into the vent. Lava moves in the **form of fountain.**
            2. Composite - characterized by **eruptions of** **cooler** **and more** **viscous** **lavas** than basalt. Result in **explosive eruptions**. Lava + pyroclastic material + ashes.
            3. Caldera - **most explosive.** So explosive that when they erupt they **tend to collapse on themselves**. Collapsed depressions are called calderas.
            4. **Flood basalt provinces** - outpour **highly fluid lava that goes** **long distance****.** Deccan Traps (MH) are one of the largest such provinces, **Ajanta caves are carved into these**.
            5. **Mid-Ocean Ridge Volcanoes** - occur in oceanic areas
        16. **Volcanic landslides** - lava released **during volcanic eruptions on cooling develops into** **igneous rocks**. Cooling may take place either on reaching the surface or while lava is still in crustal portion. Classified as (a) **volcanic rocks (cooling at the** **surface****) (b) Plutonic rocks (cooling in the** **crust****),** which assume different forms called **intrusive** **forms** -
            
            1. **Batholiths** - body of magmatic materials that **cools in deeper depth of crust** develops in form of large domes. Only appear on surface **after denudation processes remove overlying materials**. **Granitic bodies. Cooled portions of magma chambers.**
            2. **Lacoliths** - large d**ome shaped intrusive bodies** with a **level base and connect by pipe** like conduit from below.
            3. Lapoliths, phacoliths, sills - **saucer shaped lava formation is lapolith**. **Near horizontal bodies of intrusive igneous rocks are called sill (thick) or sheet (thin)**. **Phacoliths - a lens-shaped mass of igneous rock intruded in folded sedimentary beds** with which it is approximately concordant and having its greatest thickness along the axes of synclines/anticlines
        
        Dykes - when lava makes its way through cracks in land, **gets solidified perpendicular to ground.** Most commonly found in **western MH area. Considered feeders for the eruptions that led to Deccan Traps**.

    4. Distribution of ocean and continents (**29% of earth's surface)**
        
        1. Continental drift - **Abraham** **Ortelius** **suggested** it first. Pellegrini drew a map of continents. **Alfred Wegner put forward the continental drift theory in 1912**. Supercontinent named **Pangea**, surrounded by mega ocean called **Panthalassa**. Pangea broke into **Laurasia and Gondwanaland around** **200m** **years ago.**
        2. Evidence in support
            
            1. **Jigsaw fit** - shorelines of Africa and S America unmistakable match, map by Bullard 1964.
            2. **Rocks of same age** - radiometric dating methods have correlated the rock formation from different continents **across the vast ocean.** Jurassic age **marine deposits** along South Atlantic shoreline suggesting oceans didn't exist before.
            3. **Tillite** - is sedimentary rock formed **out of deposits of glaciers.** Gondwana sediments from India has counterparts in 6 different landmasses across Southern Hemisphere. The base system has **thick tillite indicating extensive and prolonged glaciation.**
            4. **Placer deposits** - concurrence of rich placer deposits of gold in Ghana coast and Brazil plateau gold bearing veins.
            ![zone of weathering zone of transport by mass-wasting ](Exported%20image%2020250424103321-2.tiff)6. **Distribution of fossils** - Lemurs across India, Africa, Madagascar. Mesosaurus - across South Africa & Iraver formations.
        3. Force for drifting (Wegner) - caused by **pole fleeing force** **(relates to rotation of earth)** and **tidal force (gravitational pull of moon and sun that develops tides in oceanic waters).** Recent theories:
            
            1. Convectional current theory - **Arthur Holmes**. Convection currents **operating in mantle portion, generated due to radioactive elements** causing thermal differences in mantle portion.
            2. Mapping of ocean floor - ocean floor is **full of relief.** Existence of mountain ranges and deep trenches. **Mid oceanic ridges most active in terms of volcanic eruptions**. Rocks from **ocean younger than continental areas.**
        4. Ocean floor configuration - 3 major divisions: continental margins, deep sea basins and mid ocean ridges.
            
            ![Image result for continental margins](Exported%20image%2020250424103323-3.jpeg)2. Continental margins: transition bw continental shores and deep sea basins. **Include - continental shelf, continental slope, continental rise and deep oceanic trenches.**
            3. Abyssal plains: extensive plains lying bw **continental margins and mid oceanic ridges.**
            4. Mid-oceanic ridges: forms an **interconnected chain of mountain system within the ocean.** Longest mountain chain on surface of earth though **under oceanic water.** Has - **central rift system at the crest (intense volcanoes)**, **fractionated plateau** and **flank zone** along its length.
            ![Image result for mid oceanic ridge](Exported%20image%2020250424103324-4.png)6. Distribution of earthquakes & volcanoes - Foci of earthquakes are at **shallow depths in mid oceanic ridges** vs **Alpine-Himalayan and Pacific ones which have deep seated ones**. Rim of Pacific = rim of fire.
            7. Most of the Earth's volcanoes are located around the **Pacific Ring of Fire** because that the **location of most of the** **Earth's subduction zones**. A subduction zone is a place where one plate of **oceanic lithosphere (= the crust + uppermost mantle) is shoved under another plate**. The downgoing plate is **always the oceanic** **one.** #important
        5. Sea floor spreading - **mapping of ocean floor and palaeomagnetic studies** of rocks reveal
            
            1. Volcanic eruptions are **common along mid-oceanic ridges**
            2. Rocks at **equal distance from crest on either side** show similarities in terms of period of formation, composition and properties. **Rocks close to ridges are youngest and have normal polarity.**
            3. **Ocean crust rocks are much younger than continental rocks**, not more than 200m years old, continental rock formations go back 3b years.
            4. **Thin sediments, proving oceans not as old as continents.** #important
            5. Deep trenches have **deep seated earthquake occurrence.**
        
        **Harry Hess** proposed "sea floor spreading". **Constant eruptions at** **crest of oceanic ridges** **cause** breaking of old oceanic crust and new lava settling in, **pushing** **oceanic crust on either side**. The ocean floor thus spreads. **Spreading of one ocean doesn't cause shrinking of the other**. Floor that gets **pushed sinks down at** **oceanic trenches and gets consumed****. Ocean floor moves like conveyor belt taking continents with them**
        
        7. Plate tectonics - **McKenzie, Parker, Morgan**. Tectonic is **massive, irregularly shaped** **slab of solid rock**. Plates **move horizontally over asthenosphere** as rigid units. Plate referred as **continental or oceanic depending** on which **occupies larger portion**. Lithosphere divided into 7 major and many minor plates.
            
            1. Antarctica and surrounding ocean plate
            2. North American plate + West Atlantic & Caribbean
            3. South American plate + West Atlantic & Caribbean
            4. Pacific plate
            5. India-Australia-New Zealand plate
            6. Africa plate +East Atlantic
            7. Eurasia
            
            1. Cocos plate - (along West Central America coast)
            2. Nazca plate (along West South American coast)
            3. Arabian plate
            4. Philippine plate
            5. Caroline plate (east of Papua New Guinea)
            6. Fiji plate (NE of Australia)
        ![Image result for fiji plate](Exported%20image%2020250424103326-5.png)  
        
        **All plates without exception** have moved in geological past (Wegner believed that continents moved). Cycle of supercontinents **every 500 millions year or so**. Most recent was Pangea.
        
        11. **Plate boundaries**
            
            1. Divergent boundaries - where new crust is **generated** **as plates pull away from each other**, sites are called spreading sites. **E.g. mid-Atlantic Ridge, East Africa Rift Valley**
            2. Convergent boundaries - where crust is **destroyed as one plate dived under another**. Location where **sinking of plate occurs is called subduction zone**.
            3. Transform boundaries - crust is **neither produced nor destroyed as plates slide horizontally** past each other. Transform faults are **planes of separation, perpendicular** to mid-oceanic ridges. E.g.: San Andreas fault line. Differential movement of portion of plate (as eruptions don’t take place all along crest at same time). **Rotation of earth has effect on separated block of plate portions**.
        12. **Rate of plate movement** - determined by **strips of** **normal and reverse magnetic field** that is parallel to mid oceanic ridges. **Arctic Ridge is slowest. East Pacific Rise (Easter Island) is fastest.** Generally 5-10 cm/year￼Mobile rock beneath the rigid plates is moving in **circular manner due to slow movement of hot softened mantle.** Heat within earth comes from: **radioactive decay and residual heat.**
        13. Movement of Indian plate - Himalayan boundary is **subduction zone**. Eastern margin is spreading site, east of Australia. **Tethys Sea separated Laurasia and Gondwana**. Started moving ~200m years ago, collided 40-50 m years ago. Height of Himalayas is rising till date. Deccan Traps were formed during this movement.
    5. Minerals and rocks
        
        1. Major elements in earth - **Oxygen (47%), silicon (28%), Aluminum (8%), iron (5%), calcium (4%**). Not found exclusively but in **combination** with other elements. Mineral is a **naturally occurring organic and inorganic substance**, having **orderly atomic composition**, physical and chemical properties. At least **2000 minerals** have been identified in the earth crust; most are related to 6 rock forming minerals.
        2. Basic source of **all mineral is hot magma** **in interior of earth**. Minerals such as coal, petroleum and natural gas are **organic substances**. Gold silver graphite are **single element minerals.**
        3. Hardness - **Diamond (10), Corundum (9), Topaz (8). Specific gravity - ratio bw weight of object and weight of equal volume of water.** Object weighed in air and then in water AND divide the weight in air by difference of 2 weights. When the specific gravity is **greater than one, the object will sink**, and when the specific gravity is **less than one, then the object will float.**￼**Common Rock-forming Minerals**:
        4. |   |   |
            |---|---|
            |**Feldspar**|**50% earth's crust is composed of feldspar** [plagioclase (39%) and alkali feldspar (12%)]. Light cream to pink color. Used in ceramics and glass making.|
            |**Quartz**|Imp component of **sand and granite**. Consists of silica, hard mineral which is insoluble in water. White or colorless and used in radio and radar. **12%**|

            |Olivine|Magnesium, iron, silica. Used in jewelry. Found in basaltic rocks.|
            
        5. Metallic minerals -
            
            1. **Precious metals** - gold, silver, platinum
            2. **Ferrous metals** - iron and other metals mixed
            3. Non-ferrous metals - copper, lead, zinc, tin, aluminum.
        
        Non-metallic minerals - **Sulphur, phosphates and nitrates.** **Cement** is mixture of non-metallic minerals.
        
        7. Rocks - earth's crust is composed of rocks which is an **aggregate of one or more minerals**, rocks **don't have definite** composition of minerals. Can be hard **(granite) or soft (soapstone)**. Petrology is science of rocks. Rocks grouped under 3 families on basis of formation
            
            1. Igneous rocks - solidified from **magma** **and** **lava****.** ￼Known as primary rocks. Slow cooling (large grains), sudden cooling (small, smooth grains). E.g. **Granite (coarse), basalt (fine)**
            2. Sedimentary - result of deposition of fragments of rocks by **exogenous processes**. Rocks -> exogenous agencies -> **compaction into rocks and process called** **lithification** **(lithification is a process of porosity destruction** through compaction and cementation). Classified into: a) Mechanically formed or dynamic metamorphism (**limestone, sandstone, shale)** b) organically formed (**chalk, coal**) c) chemically formed **(limestone, potash)**
            3. Metamorphic - rocks formed out of **existing rocks undergoing recrystallization**. Rocks formed under action of **pressure, volume and temperature** (PVT). Material of rocks **chemically alter and recrystallize** due to **thermal metamorphism** (contact and regional). In regional, deformation caused by **tectonic shearing together** with high temperature/pressure or both. If rock grains **arranged in layers or line, called foliation or lineation**. Alternating thin to thick layers in dark and light shades - called **banded rocks.** Types - foliated rocks **(gneiss, slate)** and non foliated rocks (**marble**).
            4. ![Image result for contact vs regional metamorphism](Exported%20image%2020250424103328-6.jpeg)
              
            
    6. Geomorphic processes
        
        1. External forces - **exogenic forces (land wearing)**. Internal forces - **endogenic forces (land building)**. Gradation is wearing down of relief of **earth through erosion**. Variations on surface of earth will remain because of **opposing exogenic and endogenic forces.** Both are together known as geomorphic processes. Endogenic processes - **diastrophism and volcanism.** Exogenic - **weathering, mass wasting, erosion and deposition**. Geomorphing agent - any exogenic **element of nature like water, ice, wind.** ￼Gravity - affects direction and pressure. **Without gravity and gradient there will be no erosion**.
        2. Endogenic processes - energy generated by **radioactivity****,** **rotational** **and** **tidal** **friction, and** **primordial** **heat from origin of earth.**
            
            1. Diastrophism - all processes that move or **build portion of earth's crust**, esp folding and faulting (1) orogenic - include **mountain building**, severely deformed (mountain building process) (2) epeirogenic - **uplift or warping of large parts**, simple deformation **(continental building process)** (3) **earthquakes** (4) **plate tectonics** involving horizontal movements of crustal plates.
            2. Volcanism - movement of **molten rock towards the earth's surface** and formation of **intrusive and extrusive** volcanic forms.
        3. Exogenic processes (denudation) - derive their energy from **atmosphere** **like sun, wind, air, water.** Gravitational force tends to produce down slope movement. **Force applied per unit area is called** **stress**, produced in a **solid leading** to deformation**. Shear stress breaks rocks** and other earth materials, results in angular **displacement or slippages.** Molecular stress - caused by temperature changes, crystallization and melting.
        4. |   |   |
            |---|---|
            |**Process**|**Driving force**|
            |Weathering|Gravitational/molecular stress/chemical actions|
            |Mass movements|Gravitational force|
            |Erosion/transportation|Kinetic energy|
            
        
        Temperature and precipitation **indirectly** **influence exogenic processes.** **Gravity is prime mover**. If everything being equal - type and structure of rocks matter.
        
        6. Weathering - action of elements of weather and climate over earth materials. **On-site process, or minimal movement.** Weathering process **differs from climate to climate** but also depth of weathering mantle. Major groups of weathering processes (rare for 1 to operate by itself)
            
            1. Chemical - processes such as **solution, carbonation, hydration, oxidation and reduction** act to decompose rocks to a fine clastic state.
                
                1. Solution - removal of solids in solution and solubility of mineral in water/weak acid. **Soluble rock forming minerals like nitrates, sulphates and potassium** are affected. These are **leached out without leaving any residue** in rainy climates and accumulate in dry regions. E.g. calcium carbonate, common salt.
                2. Carbonation - reaction of carbonate and bicarbonate with minerals, and helping **breaking down of feldspars and carbonate minerals.** Calcium and magnesium carbonates are **dissolved in carbonic acid and removed in a solution, resulting in cave formation.**
                3. Hydration - chemical addition of **water; minerals take up water and expand**. Calcium sulphate takes in water and turns into **gypsum**. **Reversible and long process,** may lead to disintegration. Also helps in physical weathering through exfoliation and granular disintegration.
                4. Oxidation and reduction - oxidation means combination of mineral with oxygen to form oxides or hydroxides. When oxidized minerals are placed in oxygen absent environment, reduction takes place (**usually below water table areas**). Red iron turns green/blue grey. All three go together and hasten the weathering process
            2. Physical/mechanical - depends on some applied forces (1) **gravitational forces** such as pressure, load and shearing stress (2) expansion forces due to **temperature changes** (3) **water pressures** controlled by wetting & drying cycles. Leads to rock fracture. This weathering is **caused by thermal expansion and pressure release.**
                
                1. Unloading and expansion- removal of overlying rock load causes vertical pressure release resulting in disintegration of rock masses. Fractures will develop parallel to ground surface. Large smooth rounded domes called **exfoliation** domes result due to this process (unloading and pressure release) (Bhuvanagiri, AP)
                2. Temperature changes and expansion - daily **temperature changes** causes internal movement among **upper layers of rocks**. Their subsequent exfoliation from surface results in **smooth rounded surface in rocks.** Tors are formed in granite. **Tors are formed due to temperature changes** _vs exfoliation domes which are caused by removal of overlying rock load._
                3. Freezing, thawing - growth of ice **within pores and cracks of rocks.** Most effective at high elevation in **mid-latitudes.** Glacial areas are subject to frost wedging daily. Rapid freezing of water causes sudden expansion and high pressure, breaking rock over time
                4. Salt weathering - salts in **rocks expand due to thermal action**, hydration and crystallization. Salts have tendency to expand. Salt crystals in surface pores **causes splitting of individual grains within rocks,** falling off of which results in granular foliation. Salt crystallization is most effective out of all salt-weathering processes. **Chalk** breaks down most readily with salt crystal growth.
            3. Biological - due to growth or movement of organisms. **Burrowing and wedging exposes new surfaces. Human beings disturb vegetation**. Decaying organisms create humic and carbonic acid which enhance solubility of some elements. **Plant roots exert** tremendous pressure.
        
        Significance of weathering - formation of **regolith** **(the layer of unconsolidated solid material covering the bedrock of a planet)** and soils, erosion and mass movements. Helps in **enrichment** and concentration of valuable ores.
        
        8. Mass movements - transfer of rock debris **down the slope under influence of** **gravity**. Weathering not a pre-requisite, but it **aids mass movement** (more active on weathered slopes). **Aid by gravity and** **no** **geomorphic agent participates,** they don't come under erosion. 3 types of movements - heave, slide, flow.
        ![Image result for geomorphic slide ncert](https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users('renish1419@gmail.com')/onenote/resources/0-c993427acabb3fd51c8343825aa8be28!1-26053FD2C73DCB3C!s53dabf95e6cf451e8a09b4fb1bc16951/$value)  
        
        Slow movements - creep is one type. **Solifluction involves slow downslope flowing soil mass or fine grained rock debris saturated with water** (due to alternate freezing or thawing).  
        Rapid movements - mostly in **humid climatic regions**, over gentle to steep slopes. Earthflow - movement of **water saturated silty earth materials down low angle hillsides**. Mudflow - in **absence of vegetation** cover, flows down very fast. Avalanche - occurs in **narrow tracks on steep slopes.** ￼Landslides - relatively rapid, **dry material involved.** (1) Slump - backward rotation wrt slope. (2) Debris slide - wo backward rotation (3) Rockslide - individual rock masses.￼Himalayas are mostly made up of **sedimentary** **rocks and** **unconsolidated** **(and semi) deposits and are tectonically active.** Debris avalanches and landslides are frequent.￼Western ghats - tectonically **stable but slopes are** **steep** **with vertical cliff.** Mechanical weathering due to **temperature change and range of it happens.** Plus heavy rainfall over short periods. Hence direct **rock fall + landslides + debris avalanches.**
        
        12. Erosion & deposition - **Weathering, mass wasting and erosion are degradation processes**. Erosion degrades relief and responsible for **continuous changes**. Three climatically controlled agents of erosion - **wind, water, glacier.** **Glaciers are more effective due to great mass.** ￼Karst topography - landscape **formed** from the **dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone, dolomite, and gypsum**. Characterized by **underground drainage systems with sinkholes and caves.**￼**Deposition is consequence of erosion** - not work of any agent. But happen because of same agents. **Coarser material gets deposited first** then finer ones.
        13. Soil formation (**pedogenesis**) - is **result of decay and is a medium for growth.** Soil changes internally when controlling conditions change. ￼Soil formation first depends on **weathering**. Weathering mantle (depth) is basic input, which is **colonized by bacteria and lichen and mosses and minor organisms.** Dead remains help in humus accumulation. Birds and winds will get the vegetation, plant roots, burrowing animals will contribute.
        14. Factors of soil formation -
            
            1. **Parent** **material** - **Can be in-situ or transported deposits.** In limestone area, soil show clear relation with parent rock.
            2. **Topography** - influence **due to control on sunlight and drainage.**
            3. **Climate** - active. Moisture and temperature. **Eluviation - The process of washing down material such as organic matter or minerals through the soil**. b) Illuviation - The **deposition in a soil horizon of minerals, humus and other materials.** Removal of **silica** from soil is **desilication**. Hardpans (dry climates) are formed because of **water evaporation due to capillary action, leaving salts in soil.** Kanker in tropical climates.
            4. **Biological** activity - active. Humus is **organic matter of the soil from dead plants**. Undecomposed organic matter in sub-arctic and tundra climates (layers of peat). In tropical and equatorial, very **fast oxidation leaving vey low humus in soil.** Rhizobium is a nitrogen fixing bacteria in the root nodules of leguminous plants. Earthworms change texture and chemistry of soil.
            5. **Time** - active. Soil becomes mature when processes act for a sufficiently long amount of time, there's no fixed timeline as such.
    7. Landforms & their evolution
        
        1. **Landforms (small to medium) make landscapes (large)**. Evolution of landmass also affected by - stability of sea level, tectonic stability of landmasses & climate.
        2. Running water - ￼2 components (**overland flow and linear flow**). Gentler the river channel in slope, **greater the deposition.** ￼Rill is a **shallow channel** (no more than few cms deep) **cut into soil by the erosive action o**f overland flow. These rills will **develop into gullies.** ￼Down-cutting removes steep falls -> valley sides erosion -> flattened lowlands with low resistant remnants called **monadnocks**. This type of plain is **peneplain**, **result of stream erosion**. Stages - (1) Youth - **shallow v-shaped valleys with no floodplains** (2) Mature - **integrated streams, deep valleys & rapids disappear** (3) Old - streams **meander over floodplains,** landscape at or above sea level.
            
            1. **Erosional landforms**
                
                1. Valleys - start as **small and narrow rills. Rills turn into gullies, gullies into valleys.** V shaped, gorge, canyon. **Canyon wider at top than bottom vs gorge which is equal in width**. Canyon is a variant of gorge. Canyons form in horizontal bedded **sedimentary** rocks while gorges **form in hard** rocks.
                2. Potholes and plunge holes - Large deep hole at **base of waterfalls are plunge holes**. Waterfalls are **transitory** (get created by potholes), like any other landform.
                3. **Incised (entrenched) meanders** - Very deep and wide meanders can also be found cut in **hard rocks called entrenched meanders.**
                4. River terraces - **surfaces marking floodplain levels**. Result due to **vertical erosion by stream** into its own depositional floodplain. Can be **paired or unpaired river terraces**.
            2. **Depositional landforms**
                
                1. Alluvial fans - silt deposits when a stream reaches **foot slope plains of low gradient from higher levels.** Low cones with gentle slope in humid areas.
                2. Deltas - like alluvial fans but **develop at mouth of a river**. Well sorted with **clear stratification unlike alluvial fans**. **Coarse material gets settled, finer is carried out**
                3. Floodplains, leeves and point bars - River bed made of river deposits is active floodplain. Flood plains in delta are called delta plains. Natural leeves and point bars are associated with floodplains. **Leeves are coarse deposits on the river banks, which lead to river bed rising and rising of water level**. Point bars are also **meander bars, on the convex side of meanders**, uniform **mixed sediments deposited** by flowing water along the bank.
                4. Meanders - **not a landform but a channel pattern**. **Coriolis forces** (due to the Earth’s rotation) will cause **one side of the river to flow marginally faster than the other**. No deposition and no erosion/undercutting = less meanders. **Active deposition on convex banks (slip off)** and undercutting on concave banks (cut off bank)

Braided channels - is one that is **divided into smaller channels by temporary islands called eyots**. form in rivers that have a significant amount of **sedimentary load, a steep profile** and where discharge regularly fluctuates.
        3. Ground water - downward and **horizontal movement of groundwater** causes changes. Mainly seen in **limestone and dolomites** rocks, rich in **calcium carbonate.** Krast topography is formed.
            
            1. Erosional
                
                1. **Pools, sinkholes, lapies, limestone pavements** -￼Swallow holes (small to medium) formed through **solution**. **Sinkholes have opening**. Collapse sinks (**doline**) - when **sinkholes form first over roof of a void. Solution sinks more common** than collapse. **Sink holes + dolines = valley sinks or uvalas**. Lapies: **grooves and ridges** formed on a rock surface by solution of limestone, eventually limestone pavements.
                2. Caves - formation is prominent where alternating **bed of rocks with limestone or dolomites in bw or where limestones are dense and massive**. Water moves horizontally along bedding planes, where **limestone dissolves.** Long and narrow wide gaps caves are the result.
            2. Depositional - result of **calcium carbonate deposition**
                
                1. Stalactites & stalagmites￼Icicle like formation.
                ![Related image](https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users('renish1419@gmail.com')/onenote/resources/0-01c03a1493a33ed20f15f455943c411a!1-26053FD2C73DCB3C!s53dabf95e6cf451e8a09b4fb1bc16951/$value)
        4. Glacier - Alpine, cirque, piedmont/continental. **Glacier move because of gravity**. Siachen is 2nd largest glacier in non-polar region (Fedchenko first). Gangotri glacier is source of Ganga source streams, Bhagirathi & Alaknanda.
        5. ![Image result for cirque piedmont horn](https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users('renish1419@gmail.com')/onenote/resources/0-64e127fc0e98bcde21427cb65c5730ac!1-26053FD2C73DCB3C!s53dabf95e6cf451e8a09b4fb1bc16951/$value)
            1. Erosional - by glacier is tremendous.
                
                1. Cirque - most **common of landforms here**. **Deep, long, wide basins** which might have lakes called **tarn lakes**.
                2. Horns and serrated ridges - form because of **head ward erosion of cirque walls**. An **arête** is a **thin, crest of rock left after two adjacent glaciers** have worn a steep ridge into the rock. A horn results when glaciers erode **three or more arêtes, usually forming a sharp-edged peak. Everest, Matterhorn.**
                3. Glacial valleys/troughs - **Long, U-shaped valleys that were carved out by glaciers** that have since receded. Fjords, such as those in Norway, are **coastal troughs carved out by glaciers**. ￼Truncated spurs - **steep sides of the u-shaped valley** formed by glacial bulldozing.
            2. Depositional - glacial till is **unsorted debris of melting glacier.** Rock debris carried by melt water streams is washed down and deposited, **glaco-fluvial deposits are outwash deposits (assorted and stratified).**
                
                1. Moraines - **long ridges of deposits of glacial till.** Origin is glaco-fluvial water (glacial streams). Ground moraines are **created by retreating glacier. Medial moraine is flanked by lateral moraine.**
                2. Eskers -  **serpentine ridge of gravelly and sandy drift,** believed to have been **formed by streams under or in glacial ice.**
                3. Outwash plains - outwash plain, also **sandur**, is plain **formed of glacial sediments** deposited by meltwater outwash at the terminus of a glacier.
                4. Drumlins - **smooth oval shaped ridge like composed of glacial till**.
                ![Image result for moraine eskers](https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users('renish1419@gmail.com')/onenote/resources/0-006a5fabec32b4dd25b7c822c70d6a2b!1-26053FD2C73DCB3C!s53dabf95e6cf451e8a09b4fb1bc16951/$value)
        6. Waves - coastal processes are **most dynamic and most destructive.** Depends on whether coast is **submerging or emerging.** ￼2 types of coasts to explain coastal landform evolution - ￼Submerged (**high, rocky) west coast of India** -**indented coastline, rivers appear to be drowned, erosion features dominate,** cliffs and wave cut platform. This would eventually lead to wave built terrace will form. **Bars are submerged** and when they show up are called barrier bars. #important
        ![Image result for wave depositional features](https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users('renish1419@gmail.com')/onenote/resources/0-7b3236b53dbdfdd62529253dcdc6d73b!1-26053FD2C73DCB3C!s53dabf95e6cf451e8a09b4fb1bc16951/$value)
        
        1. Erosional
            
            1. Cliffs, terraces, caves and stacks - **Waves against sea cliff break it to form terraces** over time above avg height of waves. Sea caves formed when **waves and material keep crashing**. Sea stacks are small **island of rocks near the shore**, temporary.
        2. Depositional
            
            1. Beaches and dunes - material comes from **land carried by streams** and rivers or wave erosion. Beaches are **temporary** features. Shingle beaches - which contain too many **small pebbles**. Dunes form long ridge parallel to coast.
            2. Bars, barriers and spits - **Ridge of sand and shingles in off shore parallel to coast** is off shore bar (first defense against tsunami). Barrier bar is **exposed due to more sand. Keyed with one end of bay is spit**. Spits extend to cover the bay, forming a lagoon. Lagoon overtime may become coastal plain.
        
        9. Winds
            
            1. Erosional - weathered debris in desert is **moved by wind & rain/sheet wash.**
                
                1. Pediments and pediplains - **shallow slope at the foot of a steep slope or cliff are pediments**. Formed through **lateral erosion** by streams and sheet flooding. Parallel retreat of slopes through **backwasting occurs and makes the pediment and its cliff into an inselberg.** Pediplains - **low featureless plains in formerly high relief** desert area
                2. Playas - site of a **former or occasional lake in desert plains.** Playa plains covered up by salts are called alkali flats.
                3. Deflation hollows and caves - surface depression or hollow commonly **found in arid and semiarid regions caused by wind erosion.** First depressions are shallow and called blow outs, deeper ones wide enough are caves.
                4. Mushroom, table and pedestal rocks - isolated rocks in desert whose **base is undercut by winds,** leading to a mushroom shape structure.
            ![Image result for pediment playa](https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users('renish1419@gmail.com')/onenote/resources/0-8ff1f42373846ed310ac01ae25cd15e6!1-26053FD2C73DCB3C!s53dabf95e6cf451e8a09b4fb1bc16951/$value)3. Depositional - good sorting of sand grains by wind.
                
                1. Sand dunes￼Barchan - crescent shaped dunes. Wind direction **constant**. Seif has only **one wing, else similar to barchan.**￼Parabolic - **sandy surfaces with some vegetation.** ￼Longitudinal - supply of **sand poor and wind constant**, low in height.
                ![Image result for sand dunes barchan](https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users('renish1419@gmail.com')/onenote/resources/0-04416aa2b02861d3044e308fd5ece3f6!1-26053FD2C73DCB3C!s53dabf95e6cf451e8a09b4fb1bc16951/$value)
    8. Composition of structure of atmosphere
        
        1. Air is an integral part of earth's mass and **99% of total mass of atmosphere is confined to height of 32 km from earth's surface**. Air is **colorless and odorless and can only be felt when it blows as wind.**
        2. **Carbon dioxide and water vapor are found** **only up to 90 km** from the surface of the earth. Carbon dioxide is very important gas as it is **transparent to** **incoming** **solar radiation but** **opaque** **to outgoing terrestrial radiation**. Largely responsible for green house effect. **Volume of other gases constant but CO2 is increasing due to burning of fossil fuels**. **Ozone is bw 10-50 km** above earth's surface and absorbs the ultra violet rays radiating preventing them from reaching earth
        3. Water vapor is **variable gas** in atmosphere which **decreases with altitude**. In warm & wet tropics - **4% of air by volume**, in dry and cold desert and polar regions - **<1% of air**. It absorbs **parts of insolation and preserves earth's radiated heat** - like a blanket, not too cold not too hot.
        4. Dust particles may get to higher layers **due to** **convectional** **air currents.** Less in equatorial and polar region, **more elsewhere**. Water vapor condenses **around them to produce clouds**.
        5. Structure - tropo: average 13km, **18 km at equator and 8 km at poles** because **heat is** **transported to greater heights****.** This layer has dust particles and water vapor. All **climate and weather changes are here.** Temperature decreases by **1 degree Celsius for every 165m of height** **<tropopause with constant -80 & -45 temperature at equator & pole**> strato: up to 50km **contains ozone layer**. Meso: up to 80 km. **Temperature decreases to -100 with altitude up to 80 km**, thermo: has ionosphere, radio waves are transmitted back. Exo: merges with space #important
        6. ![광 8 8 8 8 6 8 송 ](Exported%20image%2020250424103351-15.tiff)
        7. Lapse rate is the **rate at which Earth's atmospheric temperature decreases with an increase in altitude.** Around 6.5 C per km / **1 C per 165m in troposphere**
    9. Temperature
        
        1. Earth receives **most** of its energy from the sun, and **radiates it back** to space. Neither warm nor cold over a period of time. Amount of **heat received not same** across earth, **this causes** **pressure differences** **in the atmosphere.**
        2. Earth receives most of its energy in **short** **wavelengths.** Sun's rays fall obliquely on top of atmosphere and earth intercepts **very small portion** of sun's energy 1.94 calories/sq cm per minute - varies through the year due to variation in distance bw sun and earth. Earth is farthest from the sun (**152 million km**) on **4th July - known as aphelion**, less insolation. Nearest to sun on **3rd Jan (147 million km**) - called **perihelion**, more insolation. Other factors (land, sea) negate this solar variation and **hence no great effect on daily weather.**
        3. Factors that cause **variations in insolation** - angle of **inclination** of sun's rays, **rotation** of earth on its axis, **length** of day. Earth's axis makes **66 1/2 angle with plane of orbit** => influences amount of insolation received at different latitudes. Slant rays have t**o pass through more atmosphere**. Troposphere **water vapor, ozone and other gases absorb infrared radiation**. Small suspended particles in **troposphere** scatter **visible spectrum both to space and earth surface** **=> sky red and blue**. Maximum insolation received where **cloudiness is least (sub tropical desert) and more on land** than ocean. Equator receives **less** insolation than tropics (**tropics cloudiness restricted to monsoon season)**.
        4. Heating and cooling of atmosphere - Earth **radiates back heat in long wave form.** Conduction - when subsequent layers of atmosphere **get heated slowly, flow of energy from** **warmer to cooler body.** Important in heating lower layer of atmosphere. Air in contact with earth rises vertically on heating in **current form - known as convection and is restricted to troposphere**. Transfer of heat through **horizontal** movement of air is **advection** (more important). Middle latitude **diurnal variation in daily weather** caused by **advection**. **Loo is also outcome of advection process.**
        5. **Terrestrial radiation** - heating of atmosphere from **below through insolation radiation** on and off earth. Atmosphere transmits heat to space, maintaining constant temperature at earth's surface and in atmosphere. ￼Heat budget of Earth - **doesn’t accumulate or lose heat**.
        ![Related image](Exported%20image%2020250424103353-16.jpeg)
        
        Insolation at top of atmosphere = 100. 30 is scattered, reflected before reaching surface**,** **reflected amount of radiation is albedo of the earth****. Ice**, especially with snow on top of it, **has a high albedo:** most sunlight hitting the surface bounces back towards space #important
        
        8. Net heat budget at earth's surface - some part has **surplus radiation balance while other has deficit**. Surplus bw 40 degree North and South latitudes, **this heat is distributed pole wards => nor excess heat at tropics nor permafrost at poles due to deficit.**
        9. Temperature - heat is **molecular movement of particles** in a substance while temperature is **measurement in degrees** of how hot or cold. Factors controlling temperature distribution - (1) latitude of the place (2) altitude of the place (3) distance from sea, air mass circulation (4) presence of warm and cold ocean currents (5) local aspects. **Sea gets heated slowly and loses heat slowly** => moderates temperature at coasts.
        10. Distribution of temperature - **Isotherms are line joining places having equal temperature**. January - Deviation in isotherms is **more in Northern hemisphere due to larger landmass here** and ocean currents. **Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift make North Atlantic Ocean warmer and northward bend of isotherm.** ￼**July - isotherms generally parallel.** ￼Continentality - degree to which the climate of a region **typifies that of the interior** of a large landmass. **NE Eurasia is 60 degree variation highest bw Jan and July**. 15N to 20S is 3 degree which is lowest. ￼Normal lapse rate - temperature **decreases with increase in elevation 6.5 Celsius per km**
        11. Inversion of temperature is **when** **normal lapse rate is inverted****, usually short duration but quite common**. Ideal situation - **Long winter night with clear skies and still air**. Heat of land is radiated at night and by morning earth is cooler than air above. Leads to dense fog. **Over poles, normal through the year.**
        ![Cold air Warm air TEMPERATURE INVERSION Cold air Warm air Cold air ](Exported%20image%2020250424103355-17.tiff)13. Surface inversion promotes **stability in lower atmosphere** - smoke and dust particles spread beneath the **inversion layer leading to dense fogs**. ￼Air-drainage is **gravity-induced**, downslope flow of relatively cold air (inversion in the hills). Winds thus produced are called gravity winds. **Prevents plants from frost damage**.￼Plank's law - **hotter a body, more energy it will radiate, and shorter wavelength of that radiation**. Specific heat - energy needed to raise temperature of **1 gm of substance by 1 celsius.**
    10. Atmospheric circulation and weather systems -
        
        1. Air **expands when heated and gets compressed when cooled**, resulting in atmospheric pressure. It causes movement of air from **high to low pressure**.￼Atmospheric pressure - is the **weight exerted by the overhead atmosphere on a unit area of surface**, expressed in units of milibar. At sea level its **1013 milibar**. Air at surface is **denser and has higher pressure, due to gravity**. Pressure decreases with height and varies at different elevations, causing wind. Pressure reduces at the **rate of 1 mb per 10m, but not consistently**.
            
            1. Vertical pressure gradient > horizontal one, but **balanced by equal and opposite gravitational force => reason for** **no strong upward winds****.** #important
            2. Horizontal distribution of pressure: small difference in pressure but highly significant (direction and velocity). **Isobars are lines connecting places having equal pressure.** Generally studied at sea level.￼Pressure gradient - **air pressure difference** bw two locations￼Pressure gradient force - **force that actually drives air** from **high to low pressure** areas.
        2. World distribution of **sea level pressure** - ￼Not permanent in nature and **keep oscillating with movement of sun**.
        
        |   |   |   |
        |---|---|---|
        |Equatorial lows|Low pressure|Near equator|
        |Sub tropical highs|High pressure|Along 30 N & 30 S|
        |Sub polar lows|Low pressure|Along 60 N & 60 S|
        |Polar highs|High pressure|Near poles|
        
        4. Factors **affecting velocity and direction** of wind - **horizontal winds near the earth surface** respond to combined effect of 3 forces: **pressure gradient force, frictional force, Coriolis force + gravitational force acting downwards**
            
            1. Pressure gradient force - is **strong when isobars close** to each other.
            2. Frictional force - affect **speed of the wind, greatest at surface**, influence up to 1-3 km. **Minimal over sea surface.**
            3. Coriolis force - rotation of earth about its axis **affects direction of the wind, force called Coriolis** after French physicist 1844. Deflects the wind to **right direction in north hemisphere and left in south hemisphere**. Deflection is more when wind velocity is high. **Directly proportional to angle of latitude, maximum at poles and absent at equator.** Acts **perpendicular** to pressure gradient force, which in itself is **perpendicular to an isobar.**
            ![Image result for coriolis forces wind pressure gradient](Exported%20image%2020250424103357-18.jpeg)5. Higher the gradient force, **more is velocity of wind and larger is deflection** in the direction of the wind. Since Coriolis and pressure gradient forces **act perpendicularly to each other**, in **low pressure areas, wind blows around it.**
            
            **At equator, Coriolis force is zero** and **wind blows perpendicular to isobars** -> low pressure **gets filled** and not intensified. Hence **no tropical cyclones near the equator**. #important
            
        5. Pressure and wind - ￼**Geostrophic wind in** **northern hemisphere upper atmosphere free from friction** - deflected towards right. **Wind blowing parallel to isobar due to pressure gradient force and Coriolis force**.
        ![Image result for geostrophic wind](Exported%20image%2020250424103358-19.jpeg)
        
        Wind around a low pressure condition is **cyclonic** and around a **high is anti cyclonic**.
        
        |   |   |   |   |
        |---|---|---|---|
        |Low|Cyclone|**NH - anti clockwise**|SH - clockwise|
        |High|Anti cyclone|NH - clockwise|SH - anti clockwise|
        
        Wind circulation on surface around low and high pressure is **related to circulation at higher levels**. Over low pressure area - the **air will converge and rise**. Over high pressure area - **air will subside from above and diverge at surface.**
        
        10. General circulation of atmosphere - is **pattern of planetary winds**, which depend on
            
            1. **Latitudinal** variation of atmospheric heating
            2. Emergence of **pressure belt**
            3. **Migration of belts** following apparent path of sun
            4. **Distribution** of continents and oceans
            5. **Rotation** of earth
        
        This also sets in motion the **ocean water circulation** which influences earth's water climate.
        
        ![Related image](Exported%20image%2020250424103400-20.gif)
        
        Inter tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) - rises because of **convection caused by high insolation and low pressure.** Winds of tropics **converge** **at this low pressure zone.** Converged air rises along with convective cell and **reaches top of troposphere and moves towards poles. Part of accumulated air sinks at 30 N & 30 S because cooling of air and forms subtropical high.** From the surface, air flows towards the **equator as easterlies**. Easterlies from both side of the equator **converge at ITCZ. Such circulation from surface upwards and vice versa are called cells**. The tropical cell is Hadley Cell.￼In mid latitudes, the circulation is of **sinking cold air from poles and rising warm air from subtropical highs.** At surface winds are known as **westerlies** and cell is Ferrel Cell. ￼At polar latitudes, **cold dense air subsides near the poles and blows towards middle latitudes as polar easterlies**. This is cell is Polar cell. ￼These three cells set the pattern for general circulation of atmosphere. **Transfer of heat energy from lower latitudes to higher latitudes maintains the general circulation.**
        
        14. Large scale winds of atmosphere **initiate large and slow moving currents** in the ocean. Warming and cooling of **Pacific Ocean is most important.** Warm water of central Pacific ocean slowly replaces the cool Peruvian current, which is known as El Nino. **El Nino affects pressure changes in Central Pacific and Australia, known as southern oscillation**. In the years, **ENSO is strong => large scale variations in weather occur.**
        15. Types of winds
            
            1. **Seasonal** - wind circulation is **modified due to shifting of** **regions of maximum heating, pressure and wind belts**. SE Asia **monsoon** are caused by this
            2. Local - differences in **heating and cooling of earth surface** create these
            3. Land & sea breezes - during day, land heats up faster. Air rises over the land giving rise to a low pressure area whereas sea is relatively cool and pressure over sea is high. Thus pressure gradient is created and **wind blows from sea to land, known as sea breeze**. At night, reverse is at work. Low pressure over sea, resulting in land to sea movement of air, known as **land breeze.**
            4. Mountain and valley winds - Mountains get heated up due to heat during the day, creating low pressure => wind from valley are valley winds. During night, slopes get cooled and dense air descends => mountain winds. **Katabatic wind - cool air of high plateaus and ice fields draining into valley.** Warm wind occurs on leeward side of mountain ranges: when moisture in wind crossing mountain ranges condenses and precipitates. The dry air on leeward side then **gets warmed up by adiabatic process => melts snow in short time**. E.g. fuhn winds (Chinook)
            ![Image result for valley and mountain breezes](Exported%20image%2020250424103402-21.png)6. ![Image result for foehn winds](Exported%20image%2020250424103407-22.gif)
            7. Air masses - air over a **homogenous area (called source regions)** for a sufficiently long time a **acquires characteristics** of the area - vast plains, or ocean surfaces. **Large body of air having little horizontal variation in temperature and moisture**. Major source regions - (1) warm tropical and subtropical oceans (2) subtropical hot desert (3) cold high latitude oceans (4) snow covered continents in high latitudes (5) permanent ice in Arctic & Antarctic. Types of air masses - (1) Maritime tropical mT (2) Continent tropical cT (3) Maritime polar mP (4) Continental polar cP (5) Continental Arctic cA.
            8. Fronts - when **two air masses meet the boundary zone bw is front**. **Frontogenesis is the process of formation**. 4 types - cold, warm, stationary, occluded **(when an air mass is fully lifted from the surface)**. Occur in **mid latitudes and have steep gradient** **in temperature and pressure.**
        16. Extra tropical cyclones - in **middle and high latitudes, beyond the tropics**. Passage of **front causes** **abrupt changes** in weather conditions. These form **along polar front.** Initially stationary front, but **cold wind blows from north and warm wind from south** (anti clockwise direction in northern hemi). **Cyclone dissipates when the** **warm front is occluded.**

        Difference bw extra tropical and tropical cyclone
        
        |   |   |
        |---|---|
        |Clear frontal system|Not there|
        |Can originate over land & sea|Only sea, dissipate on land|
        |Affects much larger area|Smaller area than extra tropical|
        |**Move west to east,** less destructive|Move east to west, more destructive|
        
        20. Tropical storms - violent storm **originating over tropical ocean** and move to coastal area bringing large scale destruction caused by **violent winds, very heavy rainfall** and **storm surges**. Known as cyclones in Indian Ocean, Hurricane in Atlantic, Typhoon in Pacific and Willy-willies in western Australia.
            
            1. Conditions for tropical storms - (1) large sea surface with **temperature** **higher than 27 degree C** (2) **presence** **of** **coriolis** **force** (3) **small variation in** **vertical** **wind speed** (4) **pre-existing** **weak low pressure area** OR low level cyclonic circulation (5) **upper divergence** **above sea level system**. Condensation process in the **cumulonimbus** **clouds** surrounding the center of the storm **intensifies i**t + continuous supply of moisture from the sea. **Eye is region of calm with low pressure**. Eye wall has a **strong spiraling ascent of air to greater heights (till tropopause).** Diameter of storm can b**e 600-1200 km** in our oceans. #important

        21. Thunderstorms - occur over **small** area, caused by **intense convection** **on moist hot days**. Produces thunder and lightning. If insufficient moisture, thunderstorm can **generate dust storm**. **From severe thunderstorms, spiraling wind descends with great force and low pressure at the center** - which is a **tornado.** Generally occur in **middle latitudes where** **warmer subtropical air meets cold polar air.** **Tornado over sea is water spouts.**
    11. Water in atmosphere -
        
        1. **Water vapor in air is** **humidity**. Actual amount of water present in atmosphere is **absolute humidity** (differs place to place). Weight of water vapor per unit volume of air (g/m3). Ability of water to hold water vapor **depends entirely on its temperature.** Percentage of moisture present in atmosphere as **compared to its full capacity at given temperature** is relative humidity (which changes when temperature changes). **Greater over oceans, and least over continents**. Temperature at which **saturation** **occurs** in given sample of air is **dew point**. Dew point gives an **indication** of the humidity
        2. Amount of vapor in air is **added or withdrawn due to** **evaporation and condensation****.** Temperature at which **water starts evaporating is referred to as** **latent heat of vaporization**. If moisture content is low, **air can absorb and retain moisture**. Movement of air **replaces saturated layer with unsaturated layer** (greater movement of air, greater the evaporation).￼Transformation of vapor into water is condensation, **caused by loss of heat.** If directly condenses into solid form, its **sublimation**. **Hygroscopic condensation nuclei - microscopic particles (e.g. of sulphur dioxide, salt, dust, or smoke) in the free air**, on to which water vapor may **condense to form droplets.** Condensation takes place - (1) temperature of **air at dew point**, volume constant (2) **both volume and temperature reduced** (3) moisture is added to **air through evaporation** (relative humidity increases, reaching close to dew point) (4) **decrease** in air temperature (most favorable).
        3. Forms of condensation
            
            1. Dew - **moisture deposited on cooler surfaces such as leaves** instead of nuclei in the air. **Necessary that dew point is above freezing point.** Needs clear sky, calm air, cold long nights.
            2. Frost - on cold surfaces when **condensation takes place below freezing point**. Need clear sky, calm air, cold long nights.
            3. Fog and mist - **temperature of air mass containing large quantity of water vapor** falls suddenly, condensation takes place **within itself on fine dust particles****. Fog is cloud with base near to the ground.** Industrial smoke provides nuclei to help form fog and smog. **Mist contains more moisture than fog.**
            4. Clouds - **mass of minute water droplets** or crystals of ice formed by **condensation in free air at high elevations**. Also exist in combination of these four basic types.
                
                1. Cirrus - formed at **high altitudes** (8-12km), thin and detached, **look feathery.** **Always white****, composed** **completely** **of ice crystals**
                2. Cumulus - look like **cotton wool, at height of 4-7 km**, have flat base, exist in patches
                3. Stratus - layered clouds **covering large portions of sky. Formed due to loss of heat** or mixing of air mass of different temp
                4. Nimbus - nimbus clouds are **black or dark gray, form at middle levels or very near to surface of earth**. Extremely dense, near opaque. Shapeless masses of thick vapor.
            5. Precipitation - continues **condensation** makes **particles grow in size and when** **can't resist force of gravity.** Release of moisture is precipitation - in water form - rainfall, hexagonal crystals - snowfall. Sleet - snowfalls melts into rain and freeze onto surfaces. Hailstones - raindrops solidified into round pieces of ice.
        4. Types of rainfall - on basis of origin
            
            1. Convectional rain - **heated air rises up in convection currents**. Expands and loses heats and **condensation** with cumulus clouds. **Heavy short rainfall**, esp in **equatorial** regions.
            2. Orographic or relief rain - saturated **air mass ascends the mountains**, expands as it rises. **Temperature falls and moisture condensed**. Windward slopes receive greater rainfall. Area on leeward side is rain shadow area and gets relief rain.
            3. Cyclonic or frontal rain - same as in cyclones.
        5. Rainfall is **more over oceans** than on landmasses. Bw 45 & 65 degrees rainfall **first on western margin** of continents **due to westerlies**. **India monsoon normal rainfall is 89 cm per annum, long term avg of last 50 years. 96%-104% is normal**. Equatorial belt, windward slopes of mountains along western coast of temperate zone (Seattle) and coastal belt of monsoon lands (Konkan) - get 200cm of rain.
    12. World Climate and Climate Change
        
        1. **Koeppen's** scheme of **classification of climate is** **empirical****,** based on **mean annual and mean monthly** temperature and precipitation data. Close relationship bw vegetation and climate. **5 major climate types, 4 based on temperature and 1 on precipitation (B?).**
        2. ![Image result for koeppen's classification of climate ncert](Exported%20image%2020250424103413-25.jpeg)
        3. GROUP A - Tropical humid climate. Bw the **2 tropics because of sun being overhead throughout the year + ITCZ makes climate hot and humid**. **Range** of temperature is **low and rainfall high**
            
            1. Tropical wet **Af - near equator.** Areas are Amazon Basin, Indonesia, West & Central Africa. Thunder showers in afternoon. Tropical evergreen forest + large biodiversity.
            2. Tropical **monsoon Am - over Indian subcontinent**, NE S America, North Australia. Winter is dry. **Heavy rainfall in summer.**
            3. Tropical **wet and dry Aw** -Around north and south of Af climate. Less rainfall than Af and Am. **Longer dry season, drought prone**. Deciduous forest and grasslands.
        4. GROUP B - Dry climate. Low rainfall, not much vegetation.
            
            1. **Subtropical steppe (BSh) & Subtropical desert (BWh)** 15-35 latitudes. Located in **transition** zone between humid and dry climates. More rainfall than desert, adequate for sparse grasslands. High variable rainfall. Famines can happen. **Fog common in coastal deserts bordering cold currents. Range of temperatures is high.**
            2. Mid latitude steppe (BSk) & Mid latitude desert (BWk) **35-60 latitudes.**
        5. Group C - Warm temperate **mid latitude climates, mainly on margins of continent.**
            
            1. Humid subtropical Cwa - north of tropic of Cancer & Capricorn. **North Indian plains** and interior South China plains. **Similar to Aw + hella hot.**
            2. Mediterranean **Cs** - occurs around the Med Sea, west coast of continents in subtropical latitudes bw 30 and 40, e.g. central Chile.
            3. Humid subtropical Cfa - east part of continent in subtropical latitudes. **Air masses are unstable and cause rainfall throughout the year.** East US, South Japan, NE Argentina. Thunderstorms in summer and frontal precipitation in winter.
            4. **Marine west coast Cfb** - NW Europe, west coast of N Am, South Chile, SE Australia. BEST WEATHER DAYUM.
        6. Group D - Cold snow - forest climates
            
            1. **Humid continental Df** - north hemisphere bw 40-70. Eurasia, N Am. Winters are cold and snowy. Frost free season is short. Weather changes **short and abrupt.**
            2. **Subarctic Dw** - Mainly over NE Asia. Winter anti cyclone. Sub zero temperatures for many months. Low precipitation in summer.
        7. Group E - Cold climates, **poleward 70 latitude**.
            
            1. Tundra - **low growing mosses, lichen, flowering plants**. Region of permafrost. Summer has long duration of day light.
            2. Polar ice cap - interior Greenland and Antarctica. **Very little precipitation.**
        8. Group H - Highlands. Governed by topography. Temperature and precipitation varies.
        9. Causes of climate change - sunspots are **dark and cooler patches on the sun which increase and decrease in cyclical manner.** **Milankovitch oscillations** - **cycle in variations in the earth's orbital characteristics around the sun, wobbling of earth and changes in earth's axial tilt**. Volcanism throws up lot of aerosols into atmosphere, **reducing sun's radiation for years.**
        10. **Global warming** - Greenhouse gases absorb the **long wave radiation reflected back from earth**. Gases - Carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane, **nitrous oxide** and **ozone**. CHCs are highly effective. Ozone absorbs **ultra violet radiation in stratosphere** (UV rays convert oxygen into ozone), very effective in **absorbing terrestrial radiation when present in lower troposphere.**
            
            1. Largest concentration of GHG in atmosphere is carbon dioxide. CHCs are product of human activity, which drift into stratosphere and destroy ozone.
            2. Kyoto protocol was an effort to **reduce emission of GHG into atmosphere**. To reduce their emissions by year 2012 to 5% less than 1990 levels. 1961-90 is taken as normal reference temperature for the globe. 20th century avg temperature is **14.8 Celsius.** 2016 warmest year on record 1 degree above avg.
    13. Oceans
        
        1. Water is a **cyclic resource**, hydrological cycle describes the movement of water within earth's hydrosphere in solid, liquid, gas forms. **Water on earth surface - streams and rivers have the lowest.**
        
        |   |   |
        |---|---|
        |Oceans|97.25%|
        |Ice caps/glaciers|2.05%|
        |Groundwater|0.68%|
        |Lakes|0.01%|
        |Soil moisture|0.005%|
        |Atmosphere|0.001%|
        
        3. Relief of ocean floor - rugged with **world's largest mountain ranges, deepest trenches and largest plains.** Formed by factors of **tectonic, volcanic and depositional** processes
            
            1. Continental shelf - extended **margins of continent occupied by seas and gulfs**. Shallowest part of ocean, **avg gradient of 1 degree or less**. **Ends at every steep slope called shelf break**. Avg width is 80 km. Siberian shelf is largest at 1500km, non existent at Chile, Sumatra. Covered with sediments, **can become source of fossil fuels**.
            2. Continental slope - **connects shelf and ocean basins**. **Gradient bw 2-5 degrees**. **Indicates end of continents. Canyon and trenches** in this region. **Depth bw 200-3000m** #important
            3. Deep Sea Plain - **flattest and smoothest regions of world**. Bw 3000m-6000m. Covered with **fine grained sediments like** **clay and silt.**
            4. Oceanic deeps - steep sides **narrow basins**. 3-5km deeper than surrounding ocean floor. **Occur at base of continental slopes**, along island arcs, associated with volcanoes and earthquakes. Significant in **study of plate** movements.
        4. Minor relief features
            
            1. Mid oceanic ridges - mountain ridges can have peaks as **high as 2500m and reach above ocean's surface. Iceland is part of Mid Atlantic Ridge system.**
            2. Seamount -point summits, rising from seafloor and **don't reach surface. Volcanic in origin**, can be 3000-4500m tall. Emperor seamount in Hawaii.
            3. Submarine canyons - cutting across continental shelf and slope, **extending from mouth of large rivers.** Hudson canyon.
            4. Guyots - **flat topped undersea mountain**. Abundant in Pacific
            5. Atoll - low islands in tropical ocean, **coral reefs surrounding central depression**. Formed because of **volcanoes. Encloses a lagoon**. Maldives.
        5. Temperature of ocean water determinants -
            
            1. **Latitude** - because of amount of insolation
            2. **Unequal distribution** - oceans in north hemisphere get more heat because more land in north
            3. **Wind** - Winds blowing from the land towards the oceans (i.e. offshore winds) drive warm surface water away resulting into **upwelling of cold bottom water (rich in nutrients)** from below. Replacement of warm water by cold water introduces longitudinal variation in temperature. Contrary to this, the onshore winds pile up warm water near the coast and thus raise the temperature.
            4. **Ocean currents** - warm ocean currents raise temperature in cold areas. Gulf Stream (warm) raises temperature, Labrador (cold) lowers.
        6. Horizontal and vertical distribution of temperature
            
            1. First layer - top layer of warm oceanic water, about **500m thick, ranging bw 20 and 25 degree**s.
            2. Second layer - thermoincline, **rapid decrease** in temperature with increasing depth**, 500-1000m thick**
            3. Third layer - **very cold and extends up to deep ocean floor**. Arctic & Antarctic circles, surface water temperature is close to zero - only 1 layer.
        
        Rate of temperature decrease is **0.5 degree per latitude****. 19 degree avg in NH and 16 in SH due to less land in SH.** Max temperature at surface, **heat transmitted to lower section through convection**. Highest ocean water temperature is **not at equator but slightly north of it**
        
        8. Salinity of ocean water - **all water contains** **dissolved mineral salts****,** calculated as amount of salt g/kg. Above **25g/kg water is** **brackish**. **Ocean salinity avg is 35g/kg**. Dead sea is 10 times more. ￼Dissolved salts in sea water - **Chlorine (19%), Sodium (10%), Sulphate (3%)**, Magnesium & Calcium.￼Normal open ocean salinity range is 33-37 g/kg. **Highest salinity bw** **10 & 20 latitudes**. Low in Black Sea due to fresh river water outlets. **Low in Bay of Bengal due to fresh river water discharge.**￼Vertical distribution - **salinity changes with depth but the way it changes depends upon location of sea**. At surface **increases due to loss of water by** **evaporation** or **decrease because of** **fresh water from rivers**. At depth its **fixed**. Salinity generally increases with depth, **halocline** **where it increases sharply.** High saline water = high density, leads to mixing of water currents.
    14. Movements of ocean water
        
        1. **Horizontal motions are currents and waves. Vertical motion refer to tides.** Waves are horizontal motion of water, **water from wave doesn't move but wave trains move ahead.** Attraction of sun and moon raises ocean water twice a day. **Upwelling is a process in which deep, cold water rises toward the surface** and sinking of cold surface water are also vertical movements of water.
        2. Waves are **actually energy and not water** as such which moves across ocean surface. **Seldom affects the deep bottom water of ocean.**
            
            1. Waves slow down when approaching beach due to **friction of dynamic water and sea floor**
            2. When **depth of water is less than half of wavelength of wave, it breaks.** Largest waves are found in **open ocean.** Slow and steady waves originate from far away places, **maybe another hemisphere.**
            3. Waves travel because **wind pushes water body in its course** while **gravity pulls crests of wave** downward. Falling water **pushes former trough upwards**. Motion beneath wave is circular.
        3. Tides - **periodical rise and fall of sea level once or twice a day,** due to attraction of **sun and moon is called a tide.** Movement water caused by **meteorological effects (winds and atmospheric changes) are surges**. Surges are **NOT** regular. **Moon's pull > Sun's pull**. Another factor is **centrifugal force, which acts to counter balance the gravity**. Tide generating force is difference bw these two forces - **gravitational attraction of moon and centrifugal force**
        4. ![Image result for spring neap tides](Exported%20image%2020250424103417-26.jpeg)
            1. Tidal bulges on **wide continental shelves have greater height**. **Becomes low when they hit mid oceanic islands.** When tide is **funneled into bay or bw islands - called tidal currents.**
        5. Types of tides
            
            1. Based on frequency
                
                1. Semi-diurnal: When the **two highs and the two lows are about the same height**
                2. Diurnal: **only one high and low tide**
                3. Mixed tide: variation in **height known as mixed tides.** Along west coast of N Am and Pacific.
            2. Based on Sun, Moon and Earth positions
                
                1. **Spring tides**: when sun moon and earth in same line, height will be **higher. Occur twice - full moon and new moon**
                2. Neap tides: when sun and moon at right angles, occur twice a month
            3. Some terms
                
                1. **Perigee**: when **moon orbit closest to earth**, **unusually high and low tides occur, range is higher.** Happens once a month
                2. **Apogee**: Moon farthest from earth, moon's gravitation force is limited and tidal ranges **less than avg heights**
                3. Perihelion: When earth closest to sun around 3 Jan, **tidal ranges are much greater.**
                4. Aphelion: when earth farthest from sun around 4 July, **tidal ranges much less than avg.**
                5. **Ebb**: time bw high and low tide **when water level is falling**
                6. **Flood**: time bw high and low tide **when water level is rising**
        6. Ocean currents
            
            1. Ocean currents represent **regular volume of water in definite path and direction**. Currents are influenced by (i) primary forces that **initiate the water movement** (ii) secondary forces that **influence the current to flow**
            2. Primary forces - heating by **solar energy, wind, gravity, coriolis force**. Heating by sun causes water to expand, hence water is **8 cm higher in level at equator than in mid latitudes**. Causes slight gradient and **water tends to flow down that slope.**
            3. **Gyre is any large system of circulating ocean currents**, particularly those involved with **large wind movements.** Gyres are **caused by the Coriolis effect**. Currents are strongest at the surface. Most currents have **speed of about 5 knots.**
        7. Types of ocean currents
            
            1. Surface currents - **10% of all water in ocean**. Water are the upper **400m of ocean**
            2. Deep water currents - 90% of ocean water. Move to variation in **density and gravity.** Deep water sinks **into deep ocean basins at high latitudes** where temperatures are cold enough to cause density to increase.
            3. Cold currents - bring **cold water into warm water seas.** Found on **west coast of continents in low and middle latitudes** and on east coast in higher latitudes (only NH).
            4. Warm currents - bring **warm water into cold water areas** Observed on east coast of continents in low and middle latitudes and west coast in higher latitudes (only NH).

        8. Effects of ocean current
            
            1. West coast of continents in tropical and subtropical latitudes are **bordered by cool waters**. Avg temperatures have **narrow diurnal and annual range**
            2. West coasts of continents in middle and higher latitudes are bordered by **warm waters. Cool summers** and mild winters.
            3. Warm currents flow **parallel to east coasts of continents** in tropical and sub tropical latitudes. Results in **warm and rainy climate.**
    15. Unit 6
        
        1. Life on earth - is found **almost everywhere from poles to equator**, freezing seas to dry valleys. Ecological systems - interaction of particular group of organisms **with abiotic factors within a particular habitat resulting in clearly defined energy flows** and material cycles on land, water and air. Habitat is totality of **physical and chemical factors** that constitute the general environment.
        2. Types of ecosystems - **terrestrial (biomes) & aquatic (marine and freshwater).** Biome is plant and animal community that **covers a large geographical area, boundaries on land determined by mainly climate**
    
    Ecosystem - all ecosystems consist of abiotic (rainfall, temperature, sunlight, soil, inorganic substances, et al) and biotic (producers, consumers, decomposers, et al) factors. Transfer of energy that occurs during process of food chain is known as flow of energy. 2 types of food chains are recognized: **grazing food chain and detritus food chain.**
    
    ![Image result for grazing and detritus](Exported%20image%2020250424103423-28.png)
    
    5 major biomes - forest, desert, grassland, aquatic and altitudinal biomes.  
    Carbon cycle - carbon is one of the **basic elements of all living organisms and all organic compounds**. Biosphere contains over **half million carbon compounds.** Carbon cycle is **mainly conversion of CO2**, which results in **carbohydrates, glucose that can be converted into other organic compounds such as sucrose, starch, cellulose.**￼Oxygen cycle - oxygen is **main by-product of photosynthesis**. Combines with nitrogen to form nitrates and other minerals to form various oxides.￼Nitrogen cycle - 79% of atmosphere. Essential constituents of **essential organic compounds such as amino acids, nucleic acids, proteins, vitamins and pigments.** Only certain soil bacteria and blue green algae can utilize it directly in gaseous form, generally usable only after it is fixed which is **99% biologica**l. Can be fixed by - action of soil micro-organisms and associated plant roots, **lightning and cosmic radiation,** some marine animals. Denitrification - process of converting nitrates into free nitrogen by some types of bacteria.
    
    1. Genetic diversity - **genes are basic building blocks** of various life forms, it refers to variation of genes within species.
    2. Species diversity - **variety of species** in a defined area
    3. Ecosystem diversity - **differences bw ecosystem types and diversity** of habitats and different ecological processes occurring - constitute ecosystem diversity.
    
    The more diverse an ecosystem better are the chances for the species to survive through the attacks and adversities. ￼IUCN, IUCN Red List, Convention on Bio-diversity, Cartagena (2003) and Nagoya Protocol (2010)
    
      
    
8. **Class 11 - Physical environment**
    
    1. India location - India’s **territorial limit** further extends towards the sea up to **12 nautical miles (about 21.9 km) from the coast.** Both latitudinal and longitudinal extent of India are roughly 30° but still **North-South extent is longer** in actual distance (why? **distance between two longitudes decreases towards the poles** whereas the distance between two latitudes remains the same everywhere). Coastline of **6,100 km in the mainland and 7,517 km** in the entire geographical coast.
    
    Gulf vs strait - **A gulf is a** **deep inlet** **of the sea, surrounded by land**, with a narrow mouth whereas a **strait is a narrow** **waterway** **that connects two large water bodies.**
    
    3. Physiography -
        
        1. Peninsular Block - from **Kachchh to Rajmahal hills +Karbi Anglong and Meghalaya plateau**. Formed essentially by a **great complex of very** **ancient gneisses and granite****s**, which constitutes a major part of it. ￼Peninsula has been there since **Cambrian** **period** (570-510 mn years ago which marks an important point in the history of life on Earth; it is the time when most of the major groups of animals **first appear in the fossil record**. Called the "**Cambrian Explosion**" because of the **relatively short time over which this diversity** of forms appears). As a part of the Indo-Australian Plate, it has been subjected to **various vertical movements and block faulting.** The rift valleys of the **Narmada, the Tapi and the Mahanadi** and the **Satpura block mountains** are some examples of it.
            
            1. Western Ghats are the **mountainous faulted and eroded edge** of the Deccan Plateau. Geologic evidence indicates that they were formed during the **break-up of the supercontinent of Gondwana** some 150 million years ago.
            2. two views regarding geology of Western Ghats. One view says Western Ghats are Block Mountains **formed due to down warping of a part of land** into the Arabian Sea. Other view says that the mountains of the Western Ghats are **not true mountains, but are the faulted edge** of the Deccan Plateau.
            3. Block mountains are formed when faults or cracks in the **earth's crust force some materials or blocks of rock up and others down.** Instead of the earth folding over, the earth's crust fractures (pulls apart)
        2. Mountains - Himalayas along with other Peninsular mountains are **young, weak and flexible** in their geological structure **unlike the rigid and stable peninsular block**. Consequently, they are still subjected to the **interplay of exogenic and endogenic forces**, resulting in the development of faults, folds and thrust plains. These mountains are **tectonic in origin, dissected by fast-flowing rivers which are in their youthful stage.** Various landforms like gorges, V-shaped valleys, rapids, waterfalls, etc. are indicative of this stage.
        3. The reason behind the formation of deltas in the east coast lies in how the peninsular plateau is shaped. The plateau **slopes steeply towards the west coast and has a gentle slope towards the eastern** side. This results into:
            
            1. **short swift streams towards the west coast -** due to short course these carry **less sediment load and thus do not form deltas**. (Narmada and Tapi are exceptions as they flow in rift valleys which are formed on a **divergent plate boundary,** a crustal extension or **spreading apart of the surface**, which is subsequently further deepened by the forces of erosion)
            2. the east flowing rivers **cover large distances and deposit their sediments at the coast forming deltas** - e.g. Krishna-Godavari delta, Kaveri delta, etc.
        4. With regards to Himalayan rivers, they form **large extensive deltas irrespective** of whether they flow east or west - Ganga-Brahamaputra delta in east coast and the **Indus river delta in the west coast.** These rivers have **long courses, flow through soft sedimentary plains** thus carrying large amounts of sediments **forming massive deltas** dwarfing those formed by the peninsular rivers.
        5. Indo-Ganga-Brahmaputra plains - Originally, it was a **geo-synclinal depression** which attained its maximum development during the third phase of the Himalayan mountain formation approximately **about 64 million years ago.** Since then, it has been gradually filled by the sediments brought by the Himalayan and Peninsular rivers.
        6. North and NE mountains
            
            1. Himalayas - subdivisions are
                
                1. Kashmir or NW Himalayas - ranges such as **Karakoram, Ladakh, Zanskar, Pir Panjal**.
                    
                    1. Kashmir is bw **Greater Himalayas and Pir Panjal.** Kashmir Himalayas are also famous for Karewa formations, (Karewas are t**hick deposits of glacial clay and other material embedded with moraine**) which are useful for the cultivation of **Zafran**, a local variety of saffron.
                    2. In Kashmir Valley, the meanders in Jhelum river are **caused by the** **local base level of sediments** **provided by the erstwhile larger lake** of which the present Dal Lake is a small part. **Jhelum** **in the valley of Kashmir is still in its youth stage and** **yet forms meanders**
                    3. Pir Panjal is across HP and J&K
                2. Himachal and Uttarakhand - bw **Ravi and Kali** (tributary of Ghaghara). Drained by **Ganga and Indus**. All three ranges of Himalayas - Great, Lesser (Dhauladhar in HP and Nagtibha in UK) and Shiwalik. In the Great Himalayan range, the valleys are **mostly inhabited by the Bhotias**, nomadic groups who migrate to ‘**Bugyals’ (the summer grasslands** in the higher reaches) during summer months and return to the valleys during winters
                3. Darjeeling/Sikkim - The higher reaches of this region are **inhabited by Lepcha** tribes while the southern part, particularly the Darjeeling Himalayas, has a mixed population of Nepalis, Bengalis and tribals from Central India. In place of the Shiwaliks here (from Teesta to Dhansiri), the **‘duar formations’ (floodplains) are important**, which have also been used for the **development of tea gardens.**
                4. Arunachal - bw **Bhutan Himalayas and Diphu pass**. **Highest hydro electric power potential** due to fast flowing rivers.
                5. Eastern hills - Manipur has large lake known as ‘Loktak’ lake at the center, surrounded by **mountains from all sides**. **Mizoram** which is also known as the ‘**Molassis basin**’ which is made up of **soft unconsolidated deposits.** Garo Khasi Jaintia hills are **not part of Himalayas but Meghalaya plateau.**
        7. Northern Plains - From the north to the south, these can be divided into three major zones: the **Bhabar, the Terai and the alluvial plains**. The alluvial plains can be further divided into the Khadar and the Bhangar.
            
            1. Bhabhar - narrow belt **8-10 km parallel to the Shiwalik foothills** at the break-up of the slope. As a result of this, the streams and rivers coming from the mountains **deposit heavy materials of rocks and boulders,** and at times, **disappear in this zone.**
            2. Terai - width **10-20 km where most of the streams and rivers re-emerge without** having any properly demarcated channel, thereby, creating **marshy and swampy conditions with silty soils.** Rich vegetation and wildlife. Terai soils are rich in nitrogen and organic matter but are **deficient in phosphate**
            3. Bhangar and Khadar - consisting of **old and new alluvial deposits**
            4. ![Himalaya Bhabar Terai hadaı ](Exported%20image%2020250424103428-29.tiff)
        8. Peninsular plateau - **Delhi ridge in the northwest, (extension of Aravalis**), the **Rajmahal hills in the east, Gir range in the west** and the **Cardamom hills in the south** constitute the outer extent of the Peninsular plateau. Extension in the form of **Shillong and Karbi-Anglong** plateau. Made up of a series of **patland (lava topped) plateaus** such as Hazaribagh, Palamu, Ranchi, Malwa, Coimbatore, Karnataka. One of **oldest and most stable** landmass of India. General **elevation from west to east, hence most rivers are east flowing.** ￼**Bhima fault** **(near Latur)** needs special mention, because of its **recurrent seismic activities.** NW part of the plateau has a complex relief of ravines and gorges, e.g. ravines of Chambal, Bhind and Morena.
            
            1. Deccan plateau - **Eastern and Western Ghats meet each other at Nilgiri hills in TN**
            2. Central highlands - **Aravalis on the west, Satpura in south**. Most of the tributaries of the river **Yamuna have their origin in the Vindhyan and Kaimur ranges.**
            3. NE plateau - huge fault was created between the **Rajmahal hills and the Meghalaya plateau** during **NE movement of Indian plate.** Meghalaya plateau has highly eroded surface **due to excess SW monsoon rains.**
        9. Thar Desert - during Mesozoic era, **maybe under sea.** Desert can be divided into two parts: the northern part is **sloping towards Sindh** and the southern **towards the Rann of Kachchh**. Most of the rivers in this region are **ephemeral**. The **Luni river flowing in the southern part** of the desert is of some significance.
        10. Coastal plains - Western coastal plains are an example of **submerged coastal plain.** Narrow belt and provides **natural conditions** for the development of ports and harbors. ￼Eastern coastal plain is broader and is an **example of an emergent coast**. Because of its emergent nature, it has **less number of ports and harbors**. The continental **shelf extends** **up to 500 km** **into the sea**, which makes it difficult for the development of good ports and harbors.
        11. Islands - A&N are separated by a water body which is called the **Ten degree channel**. It is believed that these islands are an **elevated** **portion of submarine mountains**. However, some smaller islands are volcanic in origin. **Barren island** is the only active volcano (**Narcondam island** is dormant) in India is in Nicobar.
        
        Lakshadweep - The entire island group is built of **coral deposits**. The entire group of islands is broadly divided by the **Eleventh degree channel,** north of which is the Amini Island and to the south of the Laccadive Island. Minicoy is further south.
        
    4. Drainage - flow of water through **well-defined channels is known as ‘drainage**’ and the network of such channels is called a **‘drainage system**’.
        
        1. Drainage patterns -
            
            1. resembling the **branches of a tree is known as** “**dendritic**” the examples of which are the **rivers of northern plain.**
            2. rivers **originate from a hill and flow in all directions**, the drainage pattern is known as ‘**radial**’. E.g. rivers from Amarkantak
            3. When primary tributaries of rivers **flow parallel to each other and secondary tributaries join them at right angles**, the pattern is known as ‘**trellis**’.
            4. When rivers discharge their waters from **all directions into a lake or depression,** the pattern is know as ‘centripetal’. Opposite of radial.
        
        **Watershed** **is boundary line** **separating** **one drainage basin from another. Watersheds are small in area while the basins cover larger areas.**
        
        3. Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal discharge- **Nearly 77% of the drainage area** consisting of the Ganga, the Brahmaputra, the Mahanadi, the Krishna, etc. is **oriented towards the Bay of Bengal** while 23% comprising the Indus, the Narmada, the Tapi, the Mahi and the Periyar systems discharge their waters in the Arabian Sea.
        4. Size of catchment area/watershed
            
            1. **Larger than 20k sq km** - 14 drainage basins such as the Ganga, the Brahmaputra, the Krishna, the Tapi, the Narmada, the Mahi, the Pennar, the Sabarmati, the Barak, etc
            2. **Medium 2-20k sq km** - 44 river basins such as Kalindi, Periyar, Meghna
            3. **Minor <2k sq km** - a lot of them, esp falling in low rainfall area.
        5. Himalayan drainage - includes Indus, Ganga, Brahmaputra. Since these rivers are **fed both by snow and rain, they are perennial.** They form **deep gorges, V-shape valleys, rapids, waterfalls** in mountains and depositional features like **flat valley, ox-bow, flood plains, meanders and deltas** in plains. //Kosi brings HUGE quantity of sediments from its upper reaches and deposits it in the plains. The course gets blocked, and consequently, the river changes its course AKA sorrow of Bihar.
            
            1. Evolution - maybe a **mighty river known as Shiwalik or Indo-Brahma traversed the entire length** from Assam to Punjab to Sind millions of years ago. Overtime, got divided into 3 current one due to **Potwar Plateau (Delhi ridge) and Malda gap** uplifting.
        6. Indus - one of the largest basins in world. **Total length 2880 (1114 in India)**. Source - **Bokhar Chu** (Kailash mountain range). Indus here is known as **Singi Khamban.** Flows bw **Ladakh and Zanskar range.** Himalayan tributaries such as Shyok, Gilgit, Zanskar, Hunza, Nubra, Shigar, Gasting and Dras.
        7. Ganga - rises in **Gangotri glacier near Gaumukh**. Alaknanda (main headstream) source is **Satopanth** glacier above Badrinath.
            
            1. ![Image result for alaknanda river map](Exported%20image%2020250424103430-30.jpeg)
            2. ![Image result for ganga tributaries map](Exported%20image%2020250424103432-31.jpeg)
            3. Right bank tributaries - Son, Yamuna, Tons￼Left bank tributaries - Ramganga, Gomati, Ghaghara, Gandak, Kosi, Mahananda.
                
                1. Yamuna - Longest tributary, **joined by the Chambal, the Sind, the Betwa and the Ken on its right bank** which originates from the Peninsular plateau while the **Hindan, the Rind, the Sengar,** etc. join it on its left bank. Chambal rises near **Mhow** and flows towards Kota (has **Gandhi Sagar dam)**
                2. Gomati - rises in Pilibhit, meets Ganga near Varanasi
                3. **Ghaghara** - AKA **Karnali**, lower course is **Saryu**, **largest by volume,** second longest. Source is glacier of **Mapchachungo**. Tributaries - **Tila, Seti, Beri.** River **Sarda meets it (Kaliganga** in Nepal).
                4. Gandak - comprised of 2 streams - **Kali Gandak and Trishulganga**. Rises in Nepal Himalayas
                5. Kosi - **antecedent river**, source north of Everest. Main stream is **Arun**. Joined **by the Sun Kosi from the West and the Tamur Kosi from the east. It forms Sapt Kosi** after uniting with the river Arun. Its unstable nature has been **attributed to the heavy silt it carries during the monsoon season** and flooding in India has extreme effects
                6. Damodar - occupies the **eastern margins of the Chotanagpur Plateau where it flows through a rift valley** and finally joins the **Hugli**. The **Barakar** is its main tributary. Once known as the ‘sorrow of Bengal’, the Damodar has been now tamed by the Damodar Valley corporation, a multipurpose project
        8. Brahmaputra -
            
            1. one of the largest rivers of the world, has its origin in the **Chemayungdung** glacier of the Kailash range near the Mansarovar lake.
            2. Travels for 1200 km in Tibet where it is known as the **Tsangpo**, which means ‘the purifier'. Rango Tsangpo is the major right bank tributary here.
            3. Emerges as a turbulent and dynamic river after carving out a deep gorge in the Central Himalayas near Namcha Barwa. Known as **Dihang** after it emerges from the foothills. Joined by Dibang and Lohit from left and called Brahmaputra.
            4. Major left bank tributaries - Burhi Dihing, Dhansari
            5. Major right bank tributaries - Subansiri (antecedent), Kameng, Manas, Sankosh.
            6. Barak river forks as **Surma and Kushiyara** rivers and rejoin other tributaries and **form Meghna**.
        9. Peninsular drainage system - is **older** **than Himalayas**. Evident from broad, **largely** **graded shallow valleys and maturity of rivers**. Western Ghats act as a water divide. Peninsular rivers are characterized by **fixed course, absence of meanders and non-perennial** flow of water. The Narmada and the Tapi which flow through the rift valley are, however, **exceptions.**
            
            1. Evolution - three major geological events. (i) **subsidence of western flank** of peninsula leading to its **submergence under sea** (ii) **upheaval of Himalayas and consequent trough faulting**. Narmada & Tapi flow through these trough faults, **devoid of alluvial and deltaic deposits** (iii) slight tilting of block from **NW to SE direction gave orientation to entire drainage system**.
            2. Mahanadi - rises near **Sihawa in CG**. Drainage is in MP, CG and OD.
            3. Godavari - **longest peninsular river, rises near Nashik**. AKA Dakshin Ganga. Penganga, the Indravati, the Pranhita, and the Manjra are its principal tributaries.
            4. Krishna - second largest, rises in **Mahabaleshwar**. **Koyna, the Tungbhadra and the Bhima** are its major tributaries.
            5. Kaveri - rises in **Brahmagiri hills (Kodagu).** Since the upper catchment area receives rainfall during the SW monsoon season and the lower part during the NE monsoon season, the river **carries water throughout the year** with comparatively less fluctuation than the other Peninsular rivers. Tributaries - **Kabini, Bhavani, Amravati.**
            6. Narmada - rising in **Amarkantak plateau (also Son and Johila) and flowing in rift valley** bw Vindhya and Satpura ranges. **Marble rocks and Dhuandhar** falls are its major features. Forms **broad estuary at Bharuch.**
            7. Tapi - originates in **Multai (Betul MP)**
            8. Luni - It is **first known as Sagarmati, then it meets its tributary Saraswati,** which originates from **Pushkar** Lake, and from then on it gets its name Luni. Entirely **ephemeral**.
            9. West flowing small rivers - MH & GJ - Shetrunji, Bhadra, Dhadhar, **Sabarmati and Mahi** (largest small river), Vaitarna. ￼KA - Kalinadi, Bedti, Sharavati. Goa - **Mandovi, Zuari.** KL - **Bharataphuza, Periyar** (longest).
            10. East flowing small rivers - **Subarnarekha, Baitarni, Brahmani, Penner, Palar**.
            11. ![Image result for superimposed river](Exported%20image%2020250424103434-32.jpeg)
              
            
        10. River regime - **discharge** is **volume of water flowing in river** carried over period of time, **calculated as** **cusecs** **or cumecs.** Here are perennial rivers carrying water throughout the year while the non-perennial rivers have very little water during the dry season. During the rainy season, **much of the water is wasted in floods and flows down to the sea**. Similarly, when there is a flood in one part of the country, the other area suffers from drought.
        11. Delta is a **sedimentary deposit** **formed at mouth of some rivers**. It is usually **triangular** in shape. On the other hand, an estuary is a **semi-enclosed body of water where** **fresh water meets the ocean**.
        12. Thalweg - a line connecting the **lowest points of successive cross-sections along the course of a valley or river.** In international law, the of a waterway that serves as a boundary line between states. 
    5. Climate
        
        1. India has **hot monsoon climate** which is prevalent in South and SE Asia. Climate of India has many **regional variations expressed in pattern of winds, temperature and rainfall,** rhythm of seasons and degree of hotness and wetness - described as sub-type of monsoon.
        2. Factors affecting climate of India (location and relief)
            
            1. Latitude - Area north of Tropic of Cancer is **sub-tropical and temperate zone while south is in tropical zone.**
            2. Himalayan mountains - **invincible shield protecting subcontinent from cold winds.** Himalayas also **trap monsoon winds and force them to shed moisture within subcontinent.**
            3. Distribution of land and water - India flanked by Indian Ocean on three sides, **differential heating of land and sea creates air pressure zones** in different seasons in and around the subcontinent
            4. Distance from sea - interior Deccan and north have extreme temperatures whereas coastal areas have equable climate.
            5. Altitude - temperature **decreases with height.**
            6. Relief - windward sides of WG and Assam receive high rainfall while **leeward side remain dry**
        3. Factors affecting climate of India (air pressure and wind)
            
            1. Winter -
                
                1. Surface pressure and wind (lower level near surface) - influenced by **pressure in Central and West Asia**. High pressure in **north of Himalayas.** Leads to **south ward flow of air towards** the Indian sub continent in **form of dry continental air mass.** This comes into contact with **trade winds from NW India,** contact zone can be till **mid of Gangetic valley.**
                2. Jet stream and upper air circulation (3+ km above surface) - variations in atmospheric pressure **near surface** has **no role to play in making of upper air circulation**. All of west and Central Asia remain under influence of **westerly winds bw 9-13 km** and **blow parallel to Tibet highlands, known as jet streams**. Tibetan plateau **bifurcates this jet stream into 2, south one blows parallel to Himalayas in east direction and affects winter in India.**
                3. Western Cyclonic disturbances - **originate over Mediterranean sea** and brought to India by **westerly jet stream,** indicated by increase in prevailing night temperatures.
                4. **Tropical cyclones originate** over Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean.
            2. Summer -
                
                1. Surface pressure and winds - as **sun shifts northwards, wind reversal happens**. Low pressure belt of **ITCZ shifts parallel to Himalayas bw 20°-25° N**. **Westerly jet stream withdraws from India**. **Interrelationship** **bw equatorial trough (ITCZ) and withdrawal of jet stream**. Cause and effect relationship bw the two - **ITCZ attracts winds from different directions.** Maritime tropical air mass from southern hemisphere rushes here in SW direction, this **moist air current is SW monsoon.**
                2. Jet stream - an **easterly jet stream flows over southern part of peninsula in June, and move up north i**n successive months. **Do not extend beyond 30° N** in upper atmosphere.
                3. Easterly jet stream and tropical cyclones - easterly jet streams **steer the tropical depressions into India,** which has a role in distribution of monsoon rainfall over India.
            3. ITCZ - is a **low pressure zone located at the equator** where trade winds converge, and so, it is a zone where **air tends to ascend.**
                
                1. In July, the ITCZ is located around **20°N-25°N latitudes (over the Gangetic plain)**, sometimes called the monsoon trough. This monsoon trough encourages the **development of thermal low over north and northwest India.**
                2. Due to the shift of ITCZ, the trade winds of the southern hemisphere **cross the equator between 40° and 60°E longitudes and start blowing from southwest to northeast** due to the Coriolis force. It becomes southwest monsoon.
                3. In winter, the **ITCZ moves southward, and so the reversal of winds from northeast to south and southwest, takes place**. They are called **northeast monsoon.**
        4. Nature of Indian monsoon
            
            1. Onset - when sun shines directly over Tropic of Cancer**, landmass north of Indian ocean gets heated forming an intense low depression**. Pressure in south Indian ocean high (as water heats slowly). Low pressure cells attracts **SE trade winds** (**cross equator bw 60°-80° E**) which gets deflected to SW because of ICTZ. **Easterly jet sets along 15° N only after westerly jet stream has withdrawn and is responsible for burst of monsoon in India.**
            2. Rain bearing systems - 2 systems. **1st in Bay of Bengal causing rains in Northern plains.** 2nd in **Arabian sea causing rains in western coast (orographic rainfall).** Intensity of rainfall over WG is determined by -
                
                1. **Offshore meteorological conditions**
                2. Intensity of **equatorial jet stream along eastern coast of Africa**
            
            Frequency of depression over **BoB vary annually**, **paths determined by ITCZ** (whose axis oscillates) causing fluctuation in amount of rainfall.
            
            4. Break in the monsoon - when rain **fails to occur for 1 or more weeks.** Quite common
                
                1. North India - if **rain bearing storms are not frequent** along monsoon trough
                2. West coast - when **wind blows parallel to coast**
        5. Rhythm of seasons
            
            1. Cold -
                
                1. Temperature - why is north cold? **Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan are far away from moderating influence of sea.** Snowfall in Himalaya creates **cold wave situation.** Cold winds from Central Asia (Caspian Sea) brings frost and fog to NW India. Peninsula doesn't have defined winter season.
                2. Pressure - Sun shines over Tropic of Capricorn, weak high pressure over plains, but south has comparatively low pressure. **So wind starts blowing towards Indian ocean in south.** Topography determines the direction, **NW/Westerly in Ganga plains, northerly in G-B delta, NE in BoB**. Pleasant weather conditions get disturbed by **shallow depressions originating in east Mediterranean sea and traveling eastwards with westerly jet stream.**
                3. Rainfall - winter winds **don't cause rainfall as they move from land to sea**, have little humidity and **anti cyclonic circulation.** Exceptions
                    
                    1. NW India - **weak temperate cyclones from Mediterranean** sea cause **rainfall in NW India, highly beneficial for rabi crops**. Snowfall in lower Himalayas (sustains flow of Himalayan rivers in summer). Central India and north of peninsula also gets rainfall sometimes. Assam and Arunachal also get some rain. **NE monsoon also causes some rains in southern tip of peninsula.**
            2. Hot -
                
                1. Temperature - northward movement of sun towards Tropic of Cancer, temperature in **north India is more intense than south India (**moderating influence of ocean).
                2. Pressure - summer months have extensive heat and falling pressure. Heating of subcontinent causes **ITCZ to move to 25° N in July (over Thar to Patna)**. These SW monsoon winds are **displaced equatorial westerlies.** In the **heart of ITCZ, dry and hot winds blow in afternoon-midnight called loo**. Local storms are caused by **dry mass and moist air masses meeting on periphery of trough.**
                3. Local storms of hot season
                    
                    1. Mango shower - pre-monsoon shower in **KTK and KL coast**
                    2. Blossom shower - **coffee showers in KL**
                    3. **Nor westers** - **dreaded evening thunderstorms** in Bengal (**Kalbaisakhi**) and Assam (**Bardoli Chheerha**). Useful for **tea jute rice** #important
            3. SW Monsoon - Avg rainfall in India is **125 cm**
                
                1. Rain in SW monsoon **begins abruptly, immediate relief from high temperatures**. Direction of SW monsoon wind is determined by relief and thermal low pressure.
                2. Arabian sea branch -
                    
                    1. One branch is obstructed by WG - **250-400 cm rainfall after rising 900-1200m**. Low rainfall area is rain shadow area.
                    2. North of Mumbai - moving along Narmada and Tapi river valleys, cause extensive rains. **Chhotanagpur plateau gets some rain** 15 cm from this branch
                    3. Saurashtra and Kachch, then West Rajasthan and Aravalis. **Meets BoB branch in P/H and cause rainfall in Himalayas.**
                3. Bay of Bengal branch - strikes **Myanmar / SE Bangladesh and Arakan Hills deflect big portion towards subcontinent**. Monsoon enters Bengal from **S/SE direction and not SW.** Splits into 2 due to **influence of Himalayas and thermal low pressure.**
                    
                    1. One branch moves along with **Ganga valley till Punjab plains.**

                4. Tamil Nadu **stays dry during this season** - is **parallel to BoB branch at this point and in rain shadow area of Arabian branch.** Monsoon rains occur in wet spells of few days duration at a time, interspersed by breaks. Breaks are related to cyclonic depressions mainly formed at head of BoB and their crossing into mainland
            4. Retreating Monsoon - **Oct/Nov are months of retreating monsoon.** SW monsoon becomes weak as **low pressure trough starts to move southwards** with apparent movement of sun (by middle of Dec, completely off peninsula). **Marked by clear skies, rise in temperature and moist ground.** Rain in this season is associated with **passage of cyclonic depressions which originate over Andaman Sea.**
        6. India climatic type - see personal maps.
        7. Monsoon and economic life in India
            
            1. Except Himalayas, **can grow crop everywhere**. Regional variation in monsoon helps in various types of crop growth. Sudden monsoon burst **creates problem of soil erosion.** Winter rainfall by temperate cyclones is **highly beneficial for rabi crops.**

            4. Montane forests - can be classified into 2.
                
                1. Northern - Himalayan ranges show **succession of vegetation from tropical to tundra** with change in altitude. **Deciduous forests in foothills, succeeded by wet temperate type (1000-2000m)**. Evergreen broad leaf trees such as **oak and chestnut are there**. **Pine forests develop at 1500m, with chir pine** a useful commercial tree. Deodar is a high value **endemic** tree of **west** Himalayas. **Chinar and walnut sustain Kashmir handicrafts.** 2500-3000m around **temperate grasslands are also found along with spruce (Christmas tree).** 3000-4000m - **silver firs, junipers, pines, birch.** Pastures are used by **Gujjar, Bakarwals, Bhotiyas and Gaddis**. Southern slope have **thicker vegetation.** Higher than this, moss and lichen form tundra vegetation.
                2. Southern - forests found in **WG, Vindhyas and Nilgiris**. Only **1500m above sea level.** Vegetation **temperate in higher region** and tropical in lower region. **Shola forests are temperate**. Also found in **Satpura and Maikal** ranges. Trees - **magnolia, laurel, chinchona.**
            5. Littoral and swamps
                
                1. Around **70% of wetland habitats have paddy cultivation**. India has 26 sites under Ramsar Convention. Wetlands grouped under 8 categories
                    
                    1. Reservoirs of Deccan plateau in south + lagoons of southern west coast
                    2. Vast saline expanses of Raj, Guj, Kachch.
                    3. Freshwater lakes and reservoirs from Guj-Raj-MP
                    4. Delta wetlands and lagoons of east coast (Sunderbans, Chilka)
                    5. Freshwater marshes of Gangetic plain
                    6. Floodplains of Brahmaputra, marshes of NE India and Himalayas foothills
                    7. Lakes and rivers of montane Kashmir and Ladakh
                    8. Mangrove and wetlands of A&N
                2. India has **7% of mangrove forests of world. Highly developed in A&N and Sunderbans.**
        3. Forest cover in India
            
            1. India has around **24% of forests out of land area.** Forest area (based on State records) and actual forest (satellite imagery) not the same - forest area is notified and recorded though might not have trees!
        4. Social forestry - means management and protection of forests and afforestation **on barren lands with purpose of helping environmental, social and rural development.** Classified as - urban, rural and farm forestry (NC on Agri 1976).
            
            1. Urban - raising and management of trees on **private or publically owned lands** in and around urban centers for the purpose of **improving urban environment.**
            2. Farm forestry - term applied to processes under which **farmers grow trees for commercial and non-commercial purposes on their farm lands.**
            3. Community - It is the raising of trees on **community land and not on private land** as in farm forestry. All these program aim to provide for the **entire community and not for any individual.**
            4. Agro - land use system which **integrates trees and shrubs on farmlands and rural landscapes** to enhance productivity, profitability, diversity and ecosystem sustainability. 
        5. ![Image result for social forestry agroforestry](Exported%20image%2020250424103436-33.jpeg)
        6. Wildlife - **5% of all known plant and animal species on earth are found in India.** ￼Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 is an **Act of the Parliament** of India enacted for protection of plants and animal species.
            
            1. Before 1972, India **only had 5** designated national parks.
            2. Act established schedules of protected plant and animal species; hunting or harvesting these species was largely outlawed.
            3. Provided legal support to the conservation areas of the country classified as National parks, sanctuaries and closed areas.
        
        Objectives of Biosphere reserves - **Conservation** of biodiversity & ecosystem, **Development** of environment, **Logistics** network for research & monitoring.
        
    7. Soils
        
        1. Soil is mixture of **rock debris and organic materials** which develop on earth's surface. Component of soil are **mineral particles, humus, water and air.** Soil consists of 3 layers -
            
            1. Horizon A - which is topmost zone where **organic materials have got incorporated** with mineral matter, nutrients and water. Necessary for growth of plants
            2. Horizon B - transition zone bw Horizon A and Horizon C, **some organic matter.**
            3. Horizon C - composed of **loose parent material**. First stage in soil formation process.
        
        Arrangement of layers is known as soil profile. Underneath these, is **parent rock/bedrock**.
        
        3. ![O (humus or organic A (topsoil) E (eluviated horizon) mif B (subsoil) C (parent material) ](Exported%20image%2020250424103438-34.tiff)
        4. Classification of soils - ancient times soils used to be classified into two main groups - **Urvara (fertile) and Usara (sterile)**. In 16th century, soils were **classified on basis of inherent characteristics** and external features - **texture (sandy, clayey, silty, loam)** and color **(red, yellow, black)**.
        5. Soils of India have been classified into
        6. ![= 9 801VW V N 一 ](Exported%20image%2020250424103440-35.tiff)
            1. Alluvial soils - widespread in **northern plains and river valleys**. Cover almost **40% of total area** Depositional soils **transported and deposited by rivers.**
                
                1. Vary in nature - from **sandy to loamy to clayey**
                2. Rich in potash but **poor in phosphorous**, color - **light grey to ash grey.**
                3. Khadar - new alluvium deposited by floods annually
                
                Bhangar - older alluvium, deposited away from flood plains. Both contain calcareous concretions
                
            2. Black soils - covers **most of Deccan**. It is very deep in some parts. AKA **regur soil** or black cotton soil.
                
                1. **Clayey, deep and impermeable**
                2. Swell and become sticky when wet; and shrink when dried. Develop wide cracks during dry season, thus **self ploughing occurs**.
                3. Retains moisture for a very long time and hence **crops so sustain even during dry season**
                4. Rich in lime, iron, magnesia and alumina. Also contain potash. **Lack in phosphorous, nitrogen and organic matter**. Color - deep black to grey.
            3. Red and Yellow - develops on **crystalline igneous rocks in areas of low rainfall** in east/south of Deccan
                
                1. Red color is due to **iron in crystalline and metamorphic rocks**. Looks yellow when in hydrated form
                2. Fine grained are normally fertile, but **coarse grained are poor**
                3. Poor in nitrogen, phosphorous and humus.
            4. Laterite soils - derived from word later (**means brick**). Areas of **high temperature and high rainfall.** Result of **intense leaching** due to tropical rains.
                
                1. Lime and silica are leached away, soils **rich in iron oxide and aluminum** compound are left. Humus content of soil is **removed fast by bacteria** thrives in high temperature
                2. Poor in organic matter, nitrogen, phosphate calcium. **Rich in iron oxide and potash.**
                3. Laterite not suitable for cultivate. Application of manure and fertilizer required. **Suitable for crops like cashewnut.**
                4. Widely cut as bricks for house construction
            5. Arid soils - range from red to brown in color. Generally **sandy in structure and saline in nature.** Salt content so high that **common salt is obtained** after evaporating.
                
                1. Lack **moisture and humus. Nitrogen is insufficient.** Phosphate normal.
                2. Lower horizons have kanker layers - which **restricts infiltration of water.** With irrigation, plant growth can be sustained.
            6. **Saline soils - aka usara soils.**
                
                1. Contain large amounts of **sodium, potassium, magnesium - thus are infertile** and do support vegetative growth. **Lack nitrogen and calcium.**
                2. Have more salts because of **dry climate and poor drainage.** Occur in arid and semi arid regions and in water logged and swampy areas.
                3. Structure can be **sandy to loamy.**
                4. Over exploited green revolution soils are becoming **saline soil from fertile alluvial ones**. Excessive irrigation with dry climate promotes capillary action (sponge like) which results in deposition of salt on top layer. **Add gypsum to solve problem of salinity.**
            7. Peaty soils - areas of heavy rainfall and high humidity with good growth of vegetation. Large quantity of dead organic matter gives **rich humus and organic content** (may go up to 40-50%)
                
                1. **Heavy and black in color**
                2. **Alkaline** in many areas, highly **acidic** in many areas as well. Paddy can be cultivated
            8. Forest soils - formed in forest areas where **sufficient rainfall is available.**
                
                1. Loamy and silty on valley sides. Coarse grained in upper slopes. **In Himalayas, acidic with low humus content.**
        7. Soil degradation is **decline in soil fertility** when nutritional status declines and **depth of soil goes down due to erosion and misuse**. Destruction of soil cover is soil erosion.
            
            1. Water erosion is more serious problem in India
            2. Region with deep gullies and ravines is badland topography.
            3. Eroded materials carried down to rivers and **lower their carrying capacity and cause floods**
            4. Plants add humus to soil by shedding leaves and twigs.
        8. Soil conservation - methodology to prevent soil erosion and exhaustion and improve degraded condition of soil.
            
            1. Land with **slope gradient of 15-25%** **for cultivation should not be used without terrace farming**.
            2. Contour bunding, contour terracing, controlled grazing, mixed farming and crop rotation can reduce soil erosion
            3. Prevent gully erosion and control their formation
            4. Shelter belts of trees and agro-forestry in arid areas.
    8. Natural Hazards
        
        1. Change can be a **gradual or slow process like the evolution of landforms** and organisms and it can be as **sudden and swift as volcanic eruptions,** tsunamis, earthquakes and lightening, etc. From the perspective of nature, **changes are value-neutral** (these are neither good nor bad). But from the human perspective, these are **value-loaded**. Disasters including natural disasters are changes that are **always disliked and feared by humankind**
        2. Disaster is an undesirable occurrence resulting from forces that are largely outside human control, strikes quickly with little or no warning, which causes or threatens serious disruption of life and property
            
            1. Very little is possible to prevent natural disasters; therefore, the best way out is to emphasize on **natural disaster mitigation and management**. Establishment of National Institute of Disaster Management, India, Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 1993 and the World Conference on Disaster Management in May 1994 at Yokohama, Japan, etc. are some of the concrete steps towards this direction
            2. |   |   |
                |---|---|
                |Natural Hazard|Natural Disaster|
                |circumstances in the Natural environment that have the **potential** to cause harm to people or property or both.|relatively sudden and **cause large scale, widespread death**, loss of property and disturbance to social systems and life|
                |swift or permanent aspects of the **respective environmental settings** like currents in the oceans, steep slope|when the magnitude of destruction and damage caused by it is very high|
                
            3. Previously, hazards and disasters were seen as two closely associated and interrelated phenomena, i.e. areas prone to natural hazards, were more vulnerable to disasters. Hence, people avoided tampering with the delicate balance that existed in a given ecosystem. But now **technological power has given large capacity to human intervention in nature.**
        3. Damages caused by natural disasters have global repercussions that are beyond the means and capabilities of individual nation-states to cope up with. Hence, this issue was raised at the U.N. General Assembly in 1989 and it was finally formalized at the **World Conference on Disaster Management in May 1994** at Yokohama, Japan. This was subsequently called the **Yokohama Strategy and Plan of Action for a Safer World.**
            
            1. will give priority attention to the developing countries, particularly the least developed, land-locked countries and small-island developing states;
            2. will develop and strengthen **national capacities and capabilities** and, where appropriate, **national legislation for natural and other disaster prevention,** mitigation and preparedness
        4. Tropical cyclones - are intense low pressure areas **confined to areas bw 30 N and 30 S latitudes, where high velocity wind blows**. Features -
            
            1. Large and continuous **supply of warm and moist air** that can release enormous latent heat.
            2. Strong Coriolis force that can **prevent filling of low pressure at the center** (absence of Coriolis force near the equator **prohibits the formation of tropical cyclone between 0°-5° latitude)**.
            3. **Unstable condition through the troposphere** that creates local disturbances around which a cyclone develops.
            4. **Absence of strong vertical wind wedge**, which disturbs the vertical transport of latent heat.
        
        Tropical cyclones are characterized by large pressure gradients. The center of the cyclone is mostly a **warm and low-pressure, cloudless core** known as eye of the storm. Generally, the **isobars are closely placed to each other showing high-pressure gradients.**
        
        6. In India - tropical cyclones originate in **Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea**. Most cyclones originate in monsoon season, but in **BoB mostly during Oct-Nov**. **Originate bw 16-2 N latitudes and west of 92 E.** Force of cyclone decreases with increase in distance from the sea. Coastal areas are often struck by sever cyclonic storms which results in **abnormal rise in sea level (storm surge**). **Cyclones, which cross 20°N latitude generally, recurve and they are more destructive.**
        7. Floods - Inundation of land and human settlements by the rise of water in the channels and its spill-over presents the condition of flooding.
            
            1. Causes of floods are well- established. Floods are relatively slow in occurrences and often, occur in **well-identified regions and within expected time in a year**
            2. Floods occur commonly when water in the form of surface run-off **exceeds the carrying capacity** of the river channels and streams and flows into the neighboring low-lying flood plains.
            3. **Indiscriminate deforestation, unscientific agricultural practices, disturbances along** the natural drainage channels and colonization of flood-plains and river-beds increase intensity of flooding
            
            1. Construction of flood protection embankments in the flood-prone areas, construction of dams, afforestation and discouraging major construction activities in the upper reaches of most of the flood-creating rivers, etc. are some steps that need to be taken
        8. Flash floods - occurs when it **rains rapidly on saturated soil or dry soil that has poor absorption ability.** The runoff collects in gullies and streams and, as they join to form larger volumes, often forms a **fast flowing front of water and debris.**
        9. Drought - extended **period of shortage of water** due to inadequate precipitation, excessive rate of evaporation and over utilization of water from reservoirs and ground water. Types of droughts
            
            1. **Meteorological** - situation with prolonged period of **less rainfall with unequal distribution** over time and space
            2. Agricultural drought - characterized by l**ow soil moisture** that is necessary to support crops. If **area has more than 30% of cropped area under irrigation, it is excluded from drought prone category**
            3. Hydrological drought - availability of water in aquifers, lakes, reservoirs etc **falls below what precipitation can replenish**
            4. Ecological drought - when **productivity of natural ecosystem fails due to shortage of water**, leading to damage in ecosystem
        10. India is heavily dependent on monsoon rainfall. **Almost 30% of area is drought prone.**
            
            1. **Extreme drought prone area:** west Rajasthan and north west Gujarat (Marusthali and Kachchh). Receive less than 90mm avg annual rainfall
            2. **Severe drought prone** - east Rajasthan, west MP (Malwa), interior Andhra and Karnataka (Deccan), interior parts of TN, OD and CG.
            3. Moderate - Rajasthan, UP, Haryana, parts of GJ and MH. Surrounding areas of severe areas.
        
        Consequences - Crop failure leading to **scarcity of food grains (akal), fodder (trinkal)**, inadequate rainfall, **resulting in shortage of water (jalkal)**, and often shortage in all the three (**trikal**) is most devastating. Spread of **water borne diseases due to shortage of water**￼Measures - transfer of surplus water, inter-linking rivers and dams, remote sensing for better data and information, dissemination of knowledge about drought resistant crops, rainwater harvesting.
        
        12. Landslides - rapid sliding of **large mass of bedrocks.** Landslides are largely controlled by highly localized factors (hence **difficult in monitoring and costly).** Landslide vulnerability zones
            
            1. Very high vulnerability - **highly unstable, relatively young mountainous areas in Himalayas and A&N**. **High rainfall areas in WG** and Nilgiris and NE regions.
            2. High vulnerability - difference from very high zone is **intensity and frequency of controlling** factors.
            3. Moderate to low - areas which receive **less rainfall such as Lahaul-Spiti, Aravalis, rain shadow areas of EG and WG**. Landslides due to mining activities in resource rich states
        
        Consequences - small and localized influence, but can have **far reaching effects**. Mitigation - restriction on construction and developmental activities in vulnerable areas, promoting large scale afforestation, terrace farming, construction of bunds.
        
        14. Disaster management - **difficult to eliminate disasters, particularly the natural ones**. Hence need for **preparedness and mitigation.**
            
            1. Pre-disaster management: generating data and information about disasters, preparing vulnerability maps
            2. Rescue and relief planning operations
            3. Post disaster rehabilitation and recovery, capacity building to cope up with future disasters
              
            
          
        
9. Class 12
    
    1. Human Geography - is the **synthetic study of relationship** bw human societies and earth's surface. We interact with our physical environment with the **help of technology,** which we developed after better understanding of natural laws. Interaction bw primitive human society and strong forces of nature was termed **environmental determinism**. At this stage, **human listened to nature** and was afraid of its fury. //Abujhmaad is forest area in Chhattisgarh towards Gadchiroli. ￼**Possibilism** - **absolute freedom,** when humans create possibilities with **resources obtained from nature.** Middle path bw the two is **neo-determinism or stop and go determinism**. Human beings can conquer nature by obeying it.
        
        1. Broad stages and thrust of human geography
    
    |   |   |   |
    |---|---|---|
    |Period|Approach|Features|
    |Colonial|Exploration & **description**|Discovery and exploration of new ideas|
    |Colonial|Regional analysis|**Elaborate account** of a region, regions were part of whole -> will lead to understanding of whole|
    |1930s & war|Areal differentiation|**Spatial distribution of physical and human phenomena** as they relate to one another|
    |Post war|**Spatial** organization|**Use of computer and sophisticated tools,** quantitative revolution|
    |1970s|Humanistic, radical and behavioral school|Discontent with one sided impact of quantitative revolution, human geography made relevant to **socio-political reality**|
    |1990s|Post modernism|Grand generalizations to **explain human conditions questioned,** focus on local context understanding|
    
    3. World population
        
        1. Distribution - **90% of population lives in 10% of land.** 6 countries out of top 10 are in Asia. Density is ratio of people to size of land. **India density is 382 people per sq km. Bihar** and WB top 2 (1100 around). UT are actually higher than any state (except A&NI and Dadra) **Delhi and Chandigarh** are top 2.
        2. Factors influencing -
            
            1. **Geographical** - water, landforms, comfortable climate, fertile soils.
            2. **Economic** - mineral availability, urbanization, industrialization
            3. **Socio-cultural factors -** people move away from places of social unrest
        3. Population growth - **Natural growth of population** is difference **bw births and deaths in particular region bw two points of time.** ￼**Actual growth of population** = birth - deaths + in migration - out migration.￼Three components of population change
            
            1. Births - crude birth rate is number of live births per 1000 women in a year. **CBR = Bi/P x 1000, where P is mid year population.** Population grows due to increasing birth rates but also due to decreasing death rates.
            2. Deaths - **CDR is D/P x 1000,** where P is mid year population.
            3. Migration - people do so for better economic and social life (1) push factors - wars, natural disasters (2) pull factors - security of life, peace and stability.
        4. Trends - **took 12 years in adding 1 billion from 5b to 6b.** UN estimates world population to be **11 billions by 2100. Growth rates are currently declining.** Birth rates are estimated to be **constant at 135 million and deaths increased to 80 million**. //side note **106 to 108 billion humans have ever lived**. **Negative correlation** bw economic development and population growth.
            
            1. India's current population growth rate is **1.2% with a decreasing trend.** Birth rate 19.3/1000. Death rate 7.3/1000. India will be **most populous by 2025**. India's demographic dividend will be **over by 2040.** India's **replacement fertility rate is 2.1 which we will reach by 2025.**
        5. Thomas Malthus gave population theory - mankind had a **propensity to utilize abundance for population growth** rather than for maintaining a high standard of living, which was known as **Malthusian Trap**.
    4. Population Composition
        
        1. In India, sex ratio is **females/male x 1000**. India is 940, **Kerala is top, Haryana is worst (states**). **Puducherry top (after KL), Daman worst (UTs**). **Child sex ratio is age group 0-6 years**. World - Djibouti & Latvia (top) UAE & Qatar (bottom).
        2. Age sex pyramids can be of 3 types - **expanding population** (triangular shape), constant population (bell shaped), **declining populations** ( narrow base, tapered top). In west, rural farming communities have more men and urban centers have more women due to migration. **In Asia, more women in rural as they are immobile** while men more in urban centers as they migrate.
        3. Literacy in India - percentage of population **above 7 years who can read, write and have the ability to do arithmetic calculations with understanding**.
    5. Growth & Development
        
        1. Both refer to change over a period of time. **Growth is quantitative and value neutral**. Development is qualitative change which is **always value positive.** Positive growth **doesn't** **always** **lead to development**. Access to resources, health and education are key areas in human development.
        2. 4 pillars of human development are - **equity** (equal access), **sustainability** (continuity in availability of opportunities), **productivity** (building capability) and **empowerment** (power to make choices).
        3. Approaches to human development -
            
            1. **Income approach** - one of oldest, linked to income. Level of income reflects level of freedom and thence development.
            2. **Welfare approach** - humans as beneficiaries of all development activities. Argues for higher govt expenditure on education, health and amenities.
            3. **Basic needs approach** - **proposed by ILO.** 6 basic needs - health, education, food, water, sanitation & housing. **Question of human choices is ignored.**
            4. **Capability approach** - associated with **Amartya Sen.** Building human capabilities in area of **health, education and access to resources is key**. HDI can be based on this.
        4. Measuring human development - using HDI, which measures attainments in human development. **Not most reliable, because nothing about distribution.** **￼****Human poverty index** measures the shortfall. **Non-income measure (probability of not surviving till age 40, adult illiteracy rate, people with no access to clean water, underweight children).** Looking at both index gives better picture. **Since 1990, UNDP published HDR every year.** Used HDI and poverty index (2010, replaced by **Multidimensional Poverty index. Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative + UNDP**).
        5. |   |   |
            |---|---|
            |HDI categories - ￼|India's 2016 rank is 131 out of 188 with 0.624|
            |Very high|above 0.793|
            |High|Bw 0.698 to 0.793|
            |Medium|Bw 0.522 to 0.698|
            |Low|Below 0.522|
            
    6. Primary Activities
        
        1. Earliest humans depended on **immediate environment** for their sustenance - hunting and gathering. **Gathering is practiced in high and equatorial zones.** Some gathering commercial such as betel leaves, chicle (chewing gum).
        2. Pastoralism - domestication of animals. Nomadic herding includes cattle (Africa), sheep goats camels (deserts), yaks and llamas (mountains), reindeers (sub Arctic). **Transhumance - process of migrations from plains to mountains in summers and vice versa** in winters. Gujjar-Bakarwars, Gaddis, Bhotiyas were some communities. However, borders and settlement plans of govt has limited such movements.
        
        Commercial livestock rearing - **ranching is capital intensive and organized.**
        
        4. Agriculture -
            
            1. Subsistence - all produce is for purpose of family. (1) Primitive subsistence is **shifting or slash and burn agriculture**. **Jhuming (NE India), Milpa (central America), Ladang (SE Asia)**. (2) Intensive subsistence - in densely populated regions of monsoon Asia. Can be of wet paddy (high yield, monsoon dependent) or other crops (high yield, irrigated).
            2. Plantation - introduced by **imperialists in colonies.** Tea, coffee, rubber, cotton, sugarcane, bananas, pineapples.
            3. Commercial grain - wheat, corn, barely, oats. Large farm holdings, mechanized farming. Low yield per acre but high yield per person. Mostly in grasslands areas of the world.
            4. Mixed farming - moderate in size, usual crops are wheat, barley, oats, rye, maize, fodder crops. Crop rotation and intercropping to maintain soil fertility, animal husbandry also emphasized. Eurasia and NE Americas.
            5. Dairy Farming - most advanced and efficient type of rearing milch animals. **Highly capital and labor intensive, no off season.** Near urban and industrial centers. NW Europe, Canada, SE Aus/NZ. India is largest milk producer.
            6. Mediterranean agriculture - highly specialized **commercial agriculture.** Usually along the areas of two tropics. Region important supplier of **citrus fruits. Viticulture** (grapes) is speciality.
            7. Marketing gardening & horticulture - think tulips of Netherlands. High value crops, **solely for urban markets,** small farms located with good links with urban areas and high income consumers. Also truck farming (overnight distance bw farms and market for vegetables only). Factory farming - **poultry and cattle rearing** based on modern methods and scientific breeding.
        5. Co-operative farming - group of farmers pool in resources **voluntarily for efficient and profitable farming.** Individual farms remain intact. Successful in west European countries, **esp Denmark.**
        
        Collective farming - **social ownership of means of production** and collective labor. Model of **kolkhoz** introduced in Soviet Union.
        
        7. Mining - Minerals in ancient times were **confined to tools, utensils and weapons**. Development of mining began from industrial revolution. Methods of mining are open cast and shaft mining.
    7. Secondary activities
        
        Add **value to natural resources by transforming raw materials** into valuable products.
        
        2. Manufacturing - large scale manufacturing has **characteristics such as specialization** of skills/methods of production, mechanization, technological innovation, organizational structure and stratification, uneven geographical distribution.
        3. Factors influencing industrial locations - access to market, raw materials, labor supply, sources of energy, transportation and communication facilities, govt policy, access to agglomeration economies. **Footloose industries** - dependent on specific raw materials, dependent on component parts, produce in small quantity and small labor force, non-polluting industries such as diamond, computer chips. Footloose industry is a general term for an industry that can be placed and located at any location without effect from factors such as resources or transport.
        4. Classification of manufacturing industries -
            
            1. Based on size - Cottage/household, small, large scale.
            2. Based on inputs/raw materials - agro based, mineral based, chemical based, forest based and animal based.
            3. Based on output - basic (iron and steel) and non basic (consumer goods et al)
            4. Based on ownership - public, private, joint.
        5. Large scale industrial regions (traditional) - based on **heavy industries, located near coal fields, engaged in metal smelting, heavy engineering**, chemical manufacture or textile production. Known as **smokestack industries.** Ruhr coal fields of Germany - iron and steel backbone of Germany.
        6. High tech industry - application of R&D to **manufacture product of advanced scientific and engineering character such as robotics** on assembly line, computer aided design. High tech industries which are regionally concentrated, self sustained.
        7. Iron and steel industry - India is **3rd largest producer of steel and largest of sponge iron** (direct reduced iron). Most PSU **market their steel through SAIL**. Iron extracted from iron ore by smelting in **blast furnace with coke and limestone.** Molten iron cooled and molded to form **pig iron, to which strengthening materials like manganese are added to make steel.**
        8. Cotton textile industry - 3 sub sectors: **handloom, power loom, and mill sectors.**
    8. Tertiary and Quaternary activities - manpower is **important component of service sector** as most of tertiary activities are performed by skilled labor. Tertiary activities include both production and exchange, and involve commercial output of services rather than production of tangible goods. Services rely on **specialized skills, experience and knowledge of workers** rather than production techniques like in manufacturing.
        
        1. **Tourism** is world's **single largest tertiary activity.**
        2. Entrepreneurs are empowered workers of **quaternary and quinary sector**. Quaternary involves some of following: **collection, production, dissemination of information,** activities center around research, development and advanced form of services.
        3. Quinary - highest level of **decision makers or policy makers** perform quinary activities. Focus on creation, re-arrangement and interpretation of **new and existing ideas, data interpretation and use of evaluation of new technologies.** Gold collar professionals such as senior business executives, govt officials, consultants, scientists et al.￼
    9. Transport & communication
        
        1. First **public railway line was opened in 1825 bw Stockton and Darlington in Northern England.**
        2. Road - most economical for short distances. Indian road network is **second largest 54 lakhs km but 60% is unpaved.** NH 44 is India's longest highway. Pan-American Highway **30k km is longest motor able road but cut off in between by Darien Gap.**
        3. Rail - Indian Railways is **3rd largest railway network in world comprising of 1.20 lakh km total track**. Mostly **broad gauge network** (more than 1.5m). Indian Railways is largest employer in India.
        4. Water - North Atlantic Sea Route is called **Big Trunk Route.** Suez Canal is bordered by **Port Said and Port Tewfik** (Suez) **160 km long sea-level canal.** Panama Canal - between **Colon and Panama City.** Waterways - **Rhine Waterways** are world's most heavily used. Danube, Volga, Great Lakes, Mississippi are some of the other waterways.
        5. Satellite - **Aryabhatta launched in 1979, Bhaskar I in 1979, Rohini in 1980.**￼
    10. International Trade
        
        1. **Jonbeel Mela is an annual harvest festival in Assam**. **Denmark abolished slave trade first in 1792**, Britain 1807, USA 1808. International trade is result of **specialization in production, based on principle of comparative advantage**, and mutually beneficial to trading partners.
        2. Basis of international trade - (1) difference in natural resources (2) population factors (3) stage of economic development (4) extent of foreign investment (5) transport. International trade is at **$42 trillion in 2016, EU is largest trading bloc**. Indian trade is touching **$1t (2.4% of total trade)**. **Crude oil and cars are top 2 traded item groups**. Direction of trade has reversed from mid-20th century.
        3. Global trade - good: regional specialization, higher level of production, better standard of living, worldwide availability of goods and services, diffusion of knowledge and culture. Bad: dependence, uneven level of development, exploitation, commercial rivalry, environmental impact, health effects.￼
    11. Human settlements
        
        1. Basic difference bw towns and villages is related to **occupation of residents.**￼Types of settlement - **compact and dispersed**. Settlements are decided on the basis of: **water, land, upland, building material, defense.**
        2. Rural settlements pattern - setting such as plain or coastal, function such as farming or fishing, shape (linear, cross shape, star like, t shape, circular double). Poorly equipped with infrastructure in developing countries.
        3. Urban settlements - rapid urban growth is recent phenomenon. **First million plus city was London in 1810. 48% of world lives in urban settlements**. Classification is on the basis of - **size (5000 population in India, 400 people sq km density, 75% people in non-primary activities),** occupational structure, administration (if municipality, notified area council exists), location (for rapid urbanization). Classification of cities - administrative (Canberra, New Delhi), trading/commercial (Shenzhen, Rotterdam), cultural (Varanasi, Jerusalem). Megacity has 10+ million people.
   

Weather - day to day condition of the atmosphere. Climate is average weather condition of a place for a longer period of time. Distribution of temperature is **influenced by insolation**; which is incoming solar energy intercepted by earth. Amount of insolation **decreases from the equator towards the poles**. ￼Why are cities hotter than villages - the concrete and metal and asphalt **gets heated during the day and released during the night.**￼Air pressure and us - air presses us from all directions and our **body exerts a counter pressure. Air pressure is highest at sea level and decreases with height.** Horizontally, air pressure influenced by temperature of air. Air always move from high pressure to low. Low pressure area - cloudy skies and wet weather (Mumbai). High pressure area - clear and sunny skies (Ladakh). No air on moon means no pressure. The counter pressure exerted **by human body will make blood vessels burst.**￼Wind - movement of air from high pressure area to low pressure area is called wind. 3 types of wind -  
Moisture - moisture in the air at **any time is called humidity**. **As air gets warmer, its capacity to hold water vapor increases so it becomes even more humid**. When water vapor rises it starts cooling and condenses causing formation of clouds. When it becomes too heavy, it comes down as precipitation. **Jet trail is condensed moisture from their engines**. Types of rainfall  
Grasslands
 
Indian soil types - alluvial, black, red, laterite, desertic and mountain soil. Methods of soil conservation -  
Metallic minerals found in **igneous and metamorphic rocks** formations in large plateaus. Non-metallic minerals are in **sedimentary rock** formations of **plains and young fold mountains.** Rocks containing **copper** look **blue in color.** Switzerland has no known mineral deposit. **Green diamond is rarest.** Oldest rock in western Australia 4.3b years ago. Nickel, zinc, copper is found almost everywhere. #important  
Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities - prohibits mining on the continent  
Distribution in India  
Types of fossil fuels

1. Coal - **most abundant.** Used as a domestic fuel, industries and electricity generation. Also called **buried sunshine.** China top producer.
2. Petroleum - found between **layers of rock,** refined to produce variety of products, called **black gold. USA is top producer for crude** annually since OPEC went for production cuts.
3. Natural gas - found **with petroleum deposits**, released when **crude oil brought to surface.** US/Russia top producers. US thanks to shale gas and hydraulic fracturing.

Other conventional sources

1. Hydel - Norway was **1st country to develop hydroelectricity.** China is top producer with Brazil in 2nd. India 14% of total power generation capacity is hydel.

Non conventional

1. Solar - prepare in detail
2. Wind -
3. Nuclear - obtained from nuclei of atoms of naturally occurring radio active elements like uranium and thorium, these undergo fission in nuclear reactors. Indian coast has thorium in **monazite sands** (**AP largest**, mined by Indian Rare Earths Ltd under DAE). Reactors are in Kalpakkam, Tarapur, Narora, Kaiga
4. Geothermal - heat energy from **earth in form of hot springs** - Manikaran and Puga Valley in Ladakh.
5. Tidal - **France** built first tidal station. During high tide, energy of tides used to turn the turbine installed.
6. Biogas - organic waste such as dead plant and animal material can be converted into biogas. Organic waste is decomposed by bacteria in biogas digesters to emit biogas which is basically methane and carbon dioxide. **Hydrogen sulfide is main sewage gas.**

3 types of economic activities - ￼Primary - connected with extraction and production of natural resources ￼Secondary - processing of these resources￼Tertiary - support to primary and secondary  
India's **agricultural land 60%, arable 53%**. Organic farming - organic manure and natural pesticides are used, **no genetic modification** is done to increase crop yield. ￼Types of farming  
Major crops -  
Classification on the basis of:
 
Other sources - **meteors, gravitation, magnetic field, seismic waves**. Gravitation force is not the same at different latitudes**, greater near poles and less at equator** because of #important  
Minor ones -
    
Emerged (**low, smooth and gently sloping)** - East coast of India.￼river makes **coastal plains and deltas.** Some lagoons and tidal creeks. Marshes and swamps, depositional features dominate. **Bars, barrier bars, spits and lagoon formed over time** as bottom sediments get churned.  
**Thermoincline** is boundary region where there is a **rapid decrease of temperature.** Temperature approaches zero celsius. **90% volume water** is **below thermoincline** in deep ocean. Low and middle latitude temperature structure over oceans:  
**Biodiversity & conservation -** sun and water 2 most important input for a rich biodiversity. Number of species vary, 10 million is best estimate. Biodiversity is result of hundred of millions of years of evolutionary history. Biodiversity can be discussed on 3 levels -
