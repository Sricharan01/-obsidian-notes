1. Introduction
    
    1. Economics is the study of **how societies use scarce resources to produce valuable commodities** and distribute them among people. Economy is **economics at play in a given region.** Economics has **less diversity than economies** (because of physical and human resource factors in play). Focus of economics - betterment of human life on earth. **Challenges - (1) availability of goods and services required (2) presence of supply network**
    2. How the production process in an economy be organized - vexing question which has impacted the civilized history of mankind the most. Organizing an economy -
        
        1. **Capitalistic economy** - origins in Wealth of Nations (1776) by Adam Smith, basis of classical economics. **Against heavy handed govt regulation. Stressed division of labor and laissez faire** (non-interference by govt) and invisible hand of market forces (liberalism).
        2. State economy - German philosopher Karl Marx - first came up in **Russia after Bolshevik Revolution and ideal shape in China after 1949-1985**. 2 versions of state economy - socialist and communist (absolute state ownership of all properties). Came in reaction to prevalent popular system of capitalism. Capitalism - many exploiters, communism - one exploiter.
        3. Mixed economy - Great Depression **exposed flaws in invisible hand of market** forces. Enter Keynes. Some unemployed when the economy at full potential. **Suggested strong govt intervention in the economy**. Basis of New Deal by FDR. Basic goods and services supplied by the govt - **public goods, even on deficit financing. Market socialism - Oscar Lange**. First experiment was China's 1985 open door policy. Soviets however failed in pursuing the **glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring)**. 3 roles of govt in an economy - regulator, private supplier, public supplier.
    3. Striking right balance bw role state and market in economies is process of economic reform in post WTO world. **Washington Consensus was coined by John Williamson in 1989 - set of neoliberal economic prescriptions made by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the U.S. Treasury** to developing countries that faced economic crises. Became synonymous with **neo-liberalism** (LatAm), **market fundamentalism** (Soros), **globalization** (world over).
    4. Factor cost = cost of inputs; factor/market price = factor cost + product taxes; India calculates its income at **constant market prices (NNPmp since 2015)**. NNP at FC = NNP at MC - product taxes + subsidies. CSO in 2015 made 2 effective changes
        
        1. Base year changed to 2011-12 from 2004-05, National Statistical Commission (NSC) advised to **revise base year of all economic indices every 5 years**.
        2. Methodology revised in line with **System of National Accounts**, internationally accepted.
2. Growth, Development & Happiness
    
    1. Economic growth - increase in **economic variables over a period of time** is economic growth which is quantifiable. Economic growth was **considered as cause and effect** for betterment of people's lives. High growth but low development => led to branch of economics called **'development economics'**. Economic development is **quantitative and qualitative** progress.
    2. UNDP published **Human Development Report in 1990** which had Human Development Index -> 1st attempt to define and measure level of development of economies. Led by **Mahbub ul Haq and Inge Kaul.** 3 indicators - Health (life expectancy at time of **birth**), Education (mean of years of schooling for **adults aged till 25 years**, expected years of schooling - index is geometric mean of both these indices)and Standard of Living (**GNP per capita at PPP$**). **India is rank 130 with HDI of 0.638** (medium human development) behind SL and Maldives. World Bank started using this in 90s hence **index voluntary accepted** among member countries. **Bhutan GNH 1972** (Real per capita income, good governance, environmental protection, cultural promotion). **World Happiness Report since 2012, UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network** (GDP per capita PPP, social support, healthy life expectancy at birth, freedom to make life choices, generosity, perception of corruption). India at 122 in 2016.
3. Evolution of Indian Economy
    
    1. Indian leaders **declared industry to be the prime mover** of Indian economy post Independence which was an illogical decision in hindsight (2002 Agriculture was announced to be prime mover). Points in favor of industry as prime moving force - (1) **opted to industrialize** as well as modernize farming (2) **Dominant ideology** of world, WB and IMF till 90s (3) **defense** (4) **cultivation of scientific outlook** of the masses.
4. Economic Planning
    
    1. **Imperative planning (central/command)** and **indicative planning (planning authority sets the broad goals for the economy)**￼Systems planning (less emphasis on social dimensions) and normative planning (all round, all inclusive and holistic)
5. Planning
    
    1. **Soviets adopted national planning** for the first time. First Soviet Plan in 1928. Planning for India came **naturally as country had to pull out millions from poverty** while avoiding imperialistic and capitalistic tendencies in economy. First blueprint was given by **M. Visvesvaraya** which more of a democratic capitalism. FICCI called for a National Planning Commission in the backdrop of Great Depression. Congress set up **National Planning Committee in 1938 under JLN**, with 15 members 29 sub-committees and total 350 members. How first planning institutions came up - Post War Reconstruction Committee, Consultative Committee of Economists (Mudaliar), Planning and Development Department (1944-46), Advisory Planning Board (reco - set up NPC).
    2. **Bombay Plan - 'A Plan of Economic Development of India' by 8 Indian industrialists**. Agrarian restructuring, rapid industrialization, MSME & cottage, active role of state, social welfare, et al.￼Gandhian Plan - by Sriman Narayan Agarwal. Decentralized economic for India with **self contained villages. Against centralized power of state & modern industrialization in general.** ￼People's Plan - by MN Roy. **Based on Marxist socialism**. Agriculture and industry equal priority. ￼Sarvodaya Plan - by JP Narayan. Majorly inspired by **Gandhian Plan, eventual critical of Indian planning process.** Fought for more responsibility for PRI. ￼Thus residual British govt + INC were sure of: **central planning, control & licensing, basic industries owned by state**. Planning Commission was set up by a **Cabinet resolution in 1950, non constitutional advisory body with executive powers** (derived from ex-officio chairman the PM). Basic objectives of planning were derived from provisions in Constitution, that of Fundamental Rights and DPSP.
    3. Objectives of planning in India - economic growth, poverty alleviation, employment generation, controlling income inequalities, self reliance, modernization. Industry was picked as prime moving force upon independence. PC introduced monitor able targets in Tenth Plan.
    4. 2015 National Institute for Transforming India, called NITI Aayog formed via Union Cabinet resolution. **Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) - set up in 2014 and now closed** and headed by MoS and attached to PC and evaluating center's program - recommended replacement with Reform & Solution Commission.
    
    **Niti Aayog governing council, successor to National Development Council** - consists of all chief ministers of state + Puducherry + Delhi + LG of A&NI. Chair is PM.
    
    6. Central planning - **consisted of Five-Year Plans, Twenty-Point Program and Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme.**
        
        1. Five Year Plans - have been **purely political exercise. 3 annual plans 1967-69** or Plan Holiday period.
        
        1st plan (51-56) - mainly focused in development of the primary sector. ￼2nd Plan - by Mahalanobis. He was considered architect of Indian Planning. ￼3rd plan (1962-67) - wars with China & Pak. ￼4th Plan (1969-74) Gadgil formula (central assistance to states) & **politicization of plan**. ￼5th Plan (1975-79) 20 point program (1975), **RBI given function of stabilizing inflation.** 1978-79 plan became part of Rolling Plan, then eventually original Plan. **1980 - became annual plan** & lone rolling plan year. ￼Sixth Plan (1981-85) **Garibi Hatao** through target group approach. ￼Seventh Plan (1986-90) **ended in BOP crisis**. 91 & 92 - **annual plans.** ￼Eighth Plan (1992-96) - **new economic policy.** ￼Tenth Plan (2002-06) - **agriculture is PMF.** ￼Five Year Plans now abolished - will make way for a three-year action plan, which will be part of a seven-year strategy paper and a 15-year vision document. 
        
        3. Twenty Point Program - 1975. Coordinated and intensive **monitoring of schemes by central govt. Garibi Hatao was modeled on this.**
        4. **MPLADS - 1993. Administered by MOSPI.**
    7. Multi level planning - Centre, State, District, Block, Local. Failed, led to 73 & 74 amendments (PRI).
    8. Finance Commission - constitutional body. It **can't determine capital related** issues of states, only revenue related. Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act 2003 empowers **state govt to go for market borrowings to fulfil their plan expenditure without permission, if they have enacted the Act.**
    9. Changing nature of plan perspective (from 10th plan) - **Role of states in planned development, agriculture as prime moving force, governance recognized most important factor** of development, **economic reforms at state level,** monitorable targets, differential development strategies.
    10. Criticism to planning - lack of perspective and evaluation, failure in promoting balanced growth & development, highly centralized nature of planning, wage-employment focused strategy with **excessive emphasis on PSUs**, wrong financial strategy, politicization of planning process.
    11. Inclusive growth - yields **broad based benefits and equality of opportunity**. Govt has short term policy (food & nutrition, health, housing, education) and long term policy (skill etc).
    12. Resource mobilization - essence and end result of fiscal policies of center and state govt. Done by center, state, private sector and public.
    13. Investment models - means and tools by which **govt has mobilized resources** to promote goals of planned development.
        
        1. Phase 1 (1951-69): Under Mahalanobis, statistical foundations for state-directed investments and **created the intellectual underpinnings of the license-raj and PSUs**
        2. Phase 2 (1970-73): **new Industrial policy and Joint Sector** but not in any impactful way.
        3. Phase 3 (1974-90): **Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1974 gives way to technology transfer, not foreign cash investments, up to 26%. Our own lost decades.** Taxes were structured for **maximum revenue, led to evasion**. Planned development **cut into non plan expenditure** such as health & education.
        4. Phase 4 (1990 onwards): Reform era begins and new investment model in place - basically detail LPG reforms here and PPP model, CSR funding for social goals. Overall, **private-led model.**
    14. Central Sector Schemes & Centrally Sponsored Schemes
        
        1. Central Sector Schemes - **100% funded by Union Govt and implemented by Central Govt machinery.**
        2. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)- certain **percentage is borne by state** as well, 50:50, 70:30, 75:25 or 90:10 and **implemented by state govt**. Formulated from **state list**. Funding through **Consolidated Fund of states or to implementing body.**
    15. Central Plan Assistance - is financial assistance provided by **govt to support State's FYP or Central Assistance**. Can be **grants or loans.** Controlled by Dept of Expenditure. (1) **Normal CA** - Gadgil formula (2) **Additional CA** - for externally aided projects. Scheme based. (3) **Special CA -** for special projects and programs. Only to special category status states.
    16. Last union budget - **50 CCS rationalized into 30. Divided into core (90:10 special, 60:40 others and 100 for UT) and optional (80:20, 50:50 and 100)**. For optional schemes, MoF has flexibility and portability of funds. CSS to come up **only for issues identified in National Development Agenda.** 3rd party evaluation by NITI Aayog.
    17. Program Evaluation Organization - Est 1952 as independent organization **under PC to evaluate community development program,** eventually extended to imp CSS.
    18. NITI Aayog objectives - cooperative and **competitive federalism**, think tank offering domain knowledge, shared agenda, collaborating bw center and states (best friend of states), decentralized planning, **vision & scenario planning** (from where money is to go TO where nation is to go). Members - VC (appointed by PM), part time members 2, full time members 2, ex-officio members 4 from cabinet, CEO.
6. Economic Reforms
    
    1. Washington Consensus - **neoliberal policies.**
    2. BOP crisis of 1991 - (1) **7th Plan promoted heavy external borrowing** to increase exports (2) Gulf War led to **oil import bill inflating** (3) Remittances from **ME swindled.** IMF conditions - (1) Devaluation of rupee **by 22%** (2) Import tariff duty from **130% to 30%** (3) **Excise duty +20%** (4) **Govt austerity by 10%**
    3. Liberalization is **direction**, privatization is **path** and globalization is **goal** with equal opportunity of development for the poor.
    4. First gen reforms (1991-2000) - promotion to private sector, public sector reforms, external sector reforms, financial sector reforms, tax reforms.
    5. Second gen reforms (2001-onwards) - factor market reforms (abolishing administered price mechanisms), more public sector reforms (capital market, greater financial autonomy), reforms in govt and public institutions (SEBI), legal sector reforms (upgradation of law to suit modern needs), critical area reforms (fiscal responsibility, greater tax devolution, social sector reforms)
    6. Third gen reforms (2000s) - making PRI institutions more effective, inclusive growth and development
    7. Fourth gen reforms (2000s) - internet and technology related.
    8. Two approaches to reform - **gradualist (India, marred with disappointments among the public)** or **stop-and-go (South Africa, identified sectoral inputs and outputs, political turmoil but public support)**
7. Inflation and business cycle
    
    1. It is inflation **if prices of most goods have gone up.** Rate of inflation measured on 2 indices - **Wholesale Price Index & Consumer Price Index.** Point-to-point inflation: Reference date for annual inflation is Jan 1 to Jan 1 of 2 consecutive years. Weekly rate of inflation - bw 5 pm of 2 Fridays. Why inflation occurs - pre 1970s & post 1970s Monetarist School approach
        
        1. Demand pull - **Keynesian idea, mismatch bw demand and supply.** Post 1970s, creation of extra purchasing power over same level of production due to wage revision or deficit financing.
        2. Cost push - **Keynesian idea,** increase in factor input costs pushes up prices. Post 1970s, cost push is **result of excessive creation of money.**
        3. Monetarists emphasize the role of money as the principal cause of demand-pull inflation. They contend that inflation is always a monetary phenomenon.
        4. ![Image result for monetarist theory vs keynesian](Exported%20image%2020250424103455-0.jpeg)
    2. How to contain inflation -
        
        1. Supply side - imports, increase production, check storage, transportation, distribution, hoarding
        2. Cost side - introduce tax breaks, efficient production process, tech innovations, increasing income.
        3. **Tighter money policy (short term)** & **increase production with best production practices (long term)**
    3. Types of inflation
        
        1. Low inflation - creeping inflation, usually single digit.
        2. Galloping inflation - very high inflation. Double to triple digit.
        3. Hyperinflation - Annual rates in million or trillion
    4. Variants of inflation
        
        1. Bottleneck - when **supply falls drastically and demand remains at the same level.** Arises due to mismanagement or supply side accidents. Also known as structural inflation.
        2. Core inflation - doesn't include food and fuel. **Popular in west, in India those are our most vital sectors.**
    5. Important terms
        
        1. Inflationary gap - when the full-employment real GDP is X, and the aggregate demand (real GDP) is X+1, there is an inflationary gap that needs to be corrected with **contractionary fiscal policy**. **Known as expansionary gap**
        2. Deflationary gap - converse of above.
        3. Seigniorage - **profit made by a government by issuing currency**, especially the difference between the face value of coins and their production costs. Inflation is always the level to which govt goes for deficit financing
        4. Nominal/Required interest rate = **real rate + inflation premium + risk**
        5. Phillips curve - trade off bw **inflation and employment, inverse relationship**. **Friedman & Phelps challenged the curve - no long term trade off possible**. **Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) is the unemployment rate consistent with constant rate of inflation.**
        6. Reflation - restoration of economic activity, consumer prices, etc., to higher levels by **manipulating monetary policy**
        7. Stagflation - persistent **high inflation combined with high unemployment and stagnant demand** in a country's economy, led to Phillips curve **being challenged** and entry of monetarists and supply side economics.
        8. Inflation tax - refers to the **penalty for holding cash at a time of high inflation**. When the government prints more money or reduces interest rates, it floods the market with cash, which raises inflation in the long run.
    6. Inflation targeting -NZ did it first. **GoI & RBI Agreement on Monetary Policy Framework Feb 2015. 4% is the target with a band +/- 2%. RBI is said to have failed the target if outside the band for 3 consecutive quarters.**
        
        1. Skewflation - when prices of small **group of commodities only** rise over a period of time.
        2. GDP deflator - Ratio bw **GDP at current prices / GDP at constant prices**.
    7. Inflation in India - **CPI Combined is tracked by RBI to anchor its monetary policy**. #important
        
        1. WPI is the **inflation of the economy.** WPI started from 1942. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) series in India has undergone six revisions, **2011-12 is 7th series.** Three sets of data - Manufactured products 65%, Fuel & Power 15%, Primary Articles 20%. Total 697 items. **Core WPI = headline - (primary + fuel + food mfg).**

            1. Office of the Economic Adviser
            2. In DIPP Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion
            3. In Ministry of Commerce & Industry.
            ==
            ==CPI====
            1. Central Statistics Office (CSO)
            2. Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MOSPI)
            ==
            ==IIP====
            1. Same as CPI
            ==
            
        3. **CPI includes services. RBI uses CPI (combined), now geometric mean used instead of avg method (earlier)**. #important
        4. CPI basket include 448 in rural and 460 in urban. 4 CPI - CPI IW, CPI RL, CPI (RUC). **Rural CPI doesn't include housing.**
        
        Why CPI better vs WPI - **retail inflation better indicator, WPI** **excludes** **services, WPI has almost 25% fuel & metals which get affected by international prices.**
        
        6. IIP - Manufacturing > Mining > Electricity. Within IIP, following 8 are core industries because they’ve impact on almost all other economic activities: Coal, fertilizer**, electricity (20%)**, crude oil, natural gas, **refinery products (28%)**, **steel (18%**), and cement.
    8. New WPI series (2011-12) is closer to **PPI index concept as it removes indirect tax component**. After GST introduction, WPI won’t reflect it, while **consumer price inflation will continue to capture such tax component** built into the retail price of goods and services. This could potentially result in a sudden bout of WPI-CPI divergence.
    9. NHB Residex from the **National Housing Bank**, designed by a technical advisory committee comprising Government representatives, lenders and property market players, is a set of benchmarks that aims to **track housing price indicators across Indian cities.**
        
        1. Originally flagged off in July 2007, the index was discontinued in 2015 and was **refurbished and re-introduced in 2017**. It now sports enhanced city coverage (rising from 26 to 50, to be eventually raised to 100), a **new base year (2012-13) and new data sources (with data from banks and home finance companies and market surveys).**
        2. NHB is not computing the composite all India housing price index as of now.
    10. Four stages of business cycle
        
        1. Depression - extremely low aggregate demand, **low inflation, very low employment avenues**, job cuts
        2. Recovery - **inflation goes up making borrowing cheaper**
        3. Boom - accelerated and prolonged increase in demand, **demand exceeds sustainable production levels**, equilibrium disturbed hence inflation up
        4. Recession - how to counter: **tax breaks to increase disposable incomes, wage revision**. Double dip recession - 2 consecutive quarters of falling GDP.
8. Agriculture and food management
    
    1. GDP contribution **down from 55% in 1951 to 17% in 2016**. But 49% employment of people. At least half the farmlands are rain-fed. The country gets about **70% of annual rainfall in the June-September monsoon season, making it crucial for an estimated 26 crore farmers** (lot of agricultural workers make up the rest).
    2. Kharif crops - rice, maize, millets, cotton, arhar, soyabean, groundnut.￼Rabi - barley, wheat, linseed, mustard, pea, grams, oats.￼1st stage - **self sustenance and reduction of import** => physical access to food.
    
    2nd stage - **economic access to food.** National Food for Work Program, eventually **subsumed within MNREGA.** ￼3rd stage - realizing the **cost of ecology, biodiversity and subsidies**, India needs an all-in-one approach to feed its ever growing population.
    
    4. Land reforms in India -
        
        1. Phase 1 - INC pledged **reforms during Independence movement in 1935**. Aimed at removing institutional discrepancies inherited from past, address socio-economic inequality, increasing agricultural production. ￼Steps taken - **abolition of zamindari, mahalwari, ryotwari.** Tenancy reforms - **regulation of rent, security of tenure, ownership rights to tenants (land to the tiller).** Reorganization of agriculture - redistribution of agriculture, **ceiling laws**. Overall land reforms considered big failure - benefit on **only 6% of operated area** with negligible socio economic positive impact.
            
            1. Failure in land reforms **pushed State towards Green Revolution**. Why - inverse relationship bw **GR and LR. LR opposed while GR acceptable**. GR to affect even **small landholdings thus giving positive yield**. Independence from **PL480 (USAID Food for Peace)** and US neo-imperialism. International pressure and success stories.
        2. Phase 2 - Post economic reforms, **land acquisition and leasing, WTO provisions became new reality.** National Land Records Modernization Program 2008. Niti Aayog 2016 - land leasing to ease private sector investment in agriculture. Land policy for smoother and speedier acquisition for Make in India / Smart Cities.
        3. **Operational holdings** - **138 million. Operated area 160 million (Raj>MP>UP)**. Avg size of holding 1.15 hectare. **Large holding 10+ hectare are 0.7%**. Less than 2 hectares is 84%
    5. Green Revolution - centered around use of **high yielding variety of seeds developed by Norman Borlaug (Nobel 1970)** increased productivity by 200%. Haryana, Punjab and West UP.
        
        1. HYV seeds - **non photosynthetic hence non depended on sun rays for targeted yield**. Seeds were popularly called **dwarf seeds as the plant was dwarf and seed heavier leading to higher yield.**
        2. Chemical fertilizers - Urea (N), Potassium (P), Potash (K).
        3. Irrigation - free of flooding & artificial water supply
        4. Chemical pesticide and germicide - non acclimatized to local pest.
        5. Chemical herbicide and weedicide - used while sowing HYV seeds
        6. Credit storage distribution - soft loans from WB.
    
    Impact - **self sufficiency + farmers income, ecological crisis (soil fertility, underground water table, environmental degradation), toxic levels in food chains**. Need of the hour: sustainable farming, organic farming.
    
    7. Cropping patterns - determined by geographic factors, food habits, infra availability, land size and financial resources, mechanical inputs and access to information, MSP. ￼**Rain fed areas are still 2/3 of cropped area. More than 250 double cropping systems followed throughout the country.** ￼Challenges in sector - productivity, Food Security Act, global markets, sustainable farming, GM crops, climate change, bad loans.
    8. Animal rearing - agricultural system in India is **predominantly mixed crop livestock** (animals, birds, fish). It supplements family income, **provide cheap nutritional food, insurance against famines, promotes sustainable agriculture.** ￼India is **rank 1 in milk production** with 155 million tons, per capita 337g/day. Operation Flood was undertaken in 60s & 70s - **world’s largest agricultural development program.**
    9. Challenges to food management - MSP (administered by **Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices** (CACP) 1965, MoA&FW. To protect the farmer against any sharp fall in prices). **MSPs started with wheat, now for 28 crops including cereals, pulses, oilseeds and other non-food crops such as raw cotton and raw jute.** ￼Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) - **on state request, procurement of perishable and horticultural commodities**. +/- 10% in production.￼Procurement price, which is the price at which government procures **only for** **food grains for buffer stocking and PDS purposes** through FCI. ￼Issue price - price at which **FCI sells its food grains** (to states, TPDS)￼Buffer stock - **for rice and wheat and pulses, so food is available at affordable price through the year.** Supply goes to Open Market Sale or TPDS. ￼Decentralized Procurement Scheme 1997 - procurement of food grains to the central government stock, **through the state agencies**, rather than through FCI.
    10. Storage - **covered godowns & cover and plinth storage (20% of total).** Stockholding capacity hasn’t kept pace with increase in production and demand for a long time. **Cold storage capacity is approx 31 MT.** ￼Economic cost of food grains = **MSP + procurement incidentals + distribution.**￼**Price Stabilization Fund** (PSF) set up in 2015 - is under **Department of Consumer Affairs** to help regulate the price volatility of **important agri-horticultural commodities like onion, potatoes and pulses** were also added subsequently.
    11. Farm subsidies -
        
        1. Direct farm subsidies - **USA et al - cash back.**
        2. Indirect farm subsidies - in form of **cheap credit, loan waivers, bill reduction in electricity and irrigation, fertilizers**. India spends roughly **2% GDP** on indirect subsidies. DBT in India launched from 2013.
    12. Food security - food available at **all time times at affordable prices** without interruptions. India has highest number of **undernourished people 15%** of total. India has highest number of food schemes in world to ensure food security
        
        1. **Integrated Child Development** (covers children **under 6,** pregnant and lactating women)
        2. **Mid Day Meal Scheme**
        3. **TPDS** (NFSA implemented through this)
        4. **Annapurna** (10kg of free food grains to people above 65, part of Natl Social Assistance Scheme, Centrally Sponsored)
        5. MNREGA
    13. Anomalies in food management under PDS - (1) Distribution cost has been rising fast. Economic cost of FCI has increased over years. Cost of inputs have led to increase in MSP as well. **Mandi charges are about 40% of total cost**. **To fund food subsidy through TPDS, govt couldn't support investment in agricultural infra**. PDS plagued with - high operation costs, high level of leakages, high admin costs, corruption and mismanagement.
    14. Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) - **statutory market committee. Administered by state Acts.** First sale in notified commodities can happen only under APMC through **licensed commission agents.** Issues with APMC -
        
        1. Fees collected (as tax) **doesn't go to govt and operations are independent of scrutiny.** Rate of commission charged may be exorbitant. Licenses raj in issuing licenses for agents**. APMC positions are politically motivated.**
    
    E-NAM - detailed in GS2. Forwards Market Commission was chief regulator of commodity futures now merged with SEBI. 1875 India traded cotton futures.
    
    16. Upstream (searching and extracting raw materials), midstream (depends on the industry), downstream (finished product and end customer interface). India needs following in supply chain management - **organized retail sector, proper level of logistics, continuously updated data on production and cropping patterns, international class packaging & care towards phytosanitary aspects.**
    17. Irrigation -
        
        1. Major irrigation schemes - **cultivable command areas (CCA) of 10,000+ hectares**
        2. Medium - CCA bw 2000-10000 hectares
        3. Minor - **up to 2000 hectares CCA**
    
    Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Program (AIB) launched  in 1996-97 for providing **financial assistance, to expedite completion of ongoing Major/Medium Irrigation**. On-farm water use efficiency can be increased with sprinkler, drip (micro irrigation) practices. ￼Water productivity in India needs to be enhanced by harvesting and recycling water, efficient on-farm water management practices, micro irrigation, use of water. **PMKSY** is promoting 'more crop per drop' for judicious use of water resources and providing water to every field of agriculture.
    
    19. Farm mechanization - need to **introduce better equipment** to save time and labor, minimize wastage, and costs. Female farm workers will need ergonomically designed tools and equipment.
        
        1. Indian **farm mechanization at below 50% as against 90%** in developed countries
        2. Growing at less than 5% in last 2 decades
        3. Tractor penetration at **38% for large farmers (20 hectares +), 1% for marginal farmers**. Need for tractor rental market, indigenous/adapted technology for farm equipment
    20. Seed - basic input for increasing productivity, **accounts for 20-25% of productivity**. Hence quality seeds valuable input. Issues - **inadequate research, early ripening and resistant varieties, high cost of seeds, shortage of supply**, non-resolution of issues related to adoption of GM seeds, govt regulation. ￼Fertilizers - sharp increase in use post Green Revolution. **Annual subsidy of almost 70k crore. DBT to farmers depending from POS data (from kharif 2017 season).** ￼Imbalances in use of fertilizers - excessive dependence on urea due to distorted pricing, **low dependence on natural nutrients**, discontinued practices of rotating crops, diversion of subsidized fertilizers to non-agricultural use. Indiscriminate use didn't proportionally improve yield but led to depletion of soil fertility. Improvements needed -
        
        1. Crop responsive & balanced use of fertilizers - **using soil health cards**
        2. Micro nutrients and organic fertilizers - linked to **additional yield in cereals, cheaper.**
        3. Nutrient management - **complex considering 138 million land holdings.**
    
    Pesticides - important to improve crop yield. But **low usage in India. Wrong practices have led to pesticides residues in food products**. Need to educate farmers about toxicity and suitability, encourage bio-pesticides. ￼Agriculture Extension Services - Kisan TV, AIR broadcast of agri-information, National Center for Management of Agricultural Extension (MANAGE)  
    India has National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)- chaired by PM and consisting of National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture.
    
    22. WTO & India - **agriculture is the biggest hurdle in the process of globalization and success of WTO.** Challenges before Indian agriculture to become successful under WTO provisions and global trade
        
        1. Self-sufficiency of food lost - cheaper imports and thus farming becomes non viable business
        2. Price stability - much like oil, dependent on global markets and to **fight dumping from agri-surplus countries**
        3. Cropping - farmers shift to crops which have **comparative price advantage, thus creating imbalance in cropping patterns**
        4. Weaker sections - will neither be able to increase their income nor able to purchase agri-goods that fluctuate too often
        5. WTO provisions - **10% percent max subsidy to total agricultural output.** Subsidies by developed economies are highly detrimental to Indian agriculture.
    23. Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS) - agriculture support given by **govt domestically.** Calculated in terms of **product and non-product (electricity, irrigation) subsidies.** 5% of total agricultural output in case of developed and 10% for developing countries.
        
        1. Amber box - **distort production and trade**, all trade subsidies except blue and green box ones. E.g. MSP, fertilizer subsidies et al.
        2. Blue box - **amber box with conditions.** For subsidies that are tied to programmes that limit production.. E.g. direct payments made to farmers in form of assistance programs.
        3. Green box - which cause **minimal or no distortions. Must not involve price support.** Not targeted at particular product or not related to current level of production or prices. VERY WIDE - **public storage for food security, pest & disease control, research & extension.**
        4. S & D box - allows developing countries for some subsidies under certain conditions, revolve around human development issues (diversion from narcotic crops). **Less than 5% of total agricultural output.**
    
    Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures - countries are **allowed to set their own health and safety standards provided** they are justified on scientific grounds and aren't arbitrary. Developing countries have termed these as **non-tariff barriers to trade.**  
    Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) - encouraging market reach to **non-agri goods of member countries.** Covers manufacturing products, fuel and mining products, fish and fish products, and forestry products. These products are **not covered by the Agreement on Agriculture or the negotiations on services**. Tariff reductions are based on **Swiss formula. Prescribes higher cut on higher tariffs and lower cuts on lower tariffs, proposed first during GATT 1978.**
    
    25. Right to Food Act - National Food Security Act, 2013 **converts into legal entitlements for existing food security program**, including Midday Meal Scheme, Integrated Child Development Services scheme and the Public Distribution System.
9. Industry & Infrastructure
    
    1. Post independence, development of Indian economy has been development of govt sector. Review of industrial policies till now
        
        1. Industrial Policy Resolution 1948 - India will be a **mixed economy, industries in central and state list**, rest industries open for **private sector with compulsory license**
        2. Industrial Policy Resolution 1956 - reservation of **industries under 3 schedules.** Schedule A - 17 areas **where center had monopoly** but number of firms went up to 254 by 1991. Schedule B - **state govt initiatives** plus expansion by private sector. Schedule C - **balance areas.** License-quota-permit raj. **Expansion of public sector. Khadi & village industries.**
        3. Industrial Policy Statement 1969 *imp* - basically a **licensing policy. Monopolistic and Restrictive Trade Practices Act** (MRTP) was passed, MRTP Commission set up. **Permission needed from govt** for expansion of large firms.
        4. Industrial Policy Statement 1973 - **core industries created**, **reserved industries for small and medium industries**, joint sector development, **Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1973 was passed**, considered draconian. 1977 blip - complete no to foreign investment, **emphasis on village industries,** District Industrial Center for **expansion of small and cottage industries at mass scale.** Reversed in 1980.
        5. Industrial Policy Resolution 1985 & 86 - **technology transfer and up to 49% FDI investment**. MRTP limit revised **to promote bigger companies, compulsory licensing for only 64 industries,** relaxation of FERA regime to achieve international standards, agriculture missions with scientific approach.
    2. New industrial policy 1991 - events that set it in motion: (1) Gulf war caused higher oil prices (2) sharp decline in remittances from Gulf due to war (3) inflation peaked 13-17% (4) gross fiscal deficit of govt at 8.4% (5) by mid-1991 India had only 2 weeks of import coverage. **IMF bailed India out with conditional support, to push us towards a structural readjustment.**
        
        1. De-reservation of industries - **only 8 strategic industries under central govt, now India has only 2** - atomic energy & nuclear research and Railways.
        2. De-licensing of industries - number of industries **under license cut down to 18.** Currently only 5 - **aerospace and defense related electronics, gunpowder & explosives, dangerous chemicals, tobacco & cigarette, alcoholic drinks**.
        3. Abolition of MRTP limit - **100cr limit done away with. Competition Act passed in 2002.**
        4. Promotion of FDI - **FDI & FII allowed, individual foreign investment in security market not allowed**. FERA replaced **with FEMA in 1999.**
        5. Location of industries - industries classified as polluting and non-polluting, latter can be established anywhere.
        6. Converting loans to shares - started after nationalization of 14 banks in 1969, indirect way of nationalization of corporates. **Glorious role given to state rolled back.**
    3. Disinvestment - **selling govt equities** in public sector enterprises. Can be used as tool of public sector reforms, de-reservation of industries, raise money for budgets. Types of disinvestment - token (minority state sale) & strategic disinvestment (minimum 51% sold). **Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) to identify PSUs to be disinvested in** - minority stake sale. Ministries/Departments/Niti Aayog to be consulted if strategic disinvestment to happen.￼Govt used it to bridge fiscal deficit gap (till 2000), then used it for funding social sector schemes (till 2004), started **National Innovation Fund** (2005 onwards), which is outside CFI. In 2013, credited back to Public Account to be used for approved purposes only.
    4. MSME sector - MSMEs **contribute 37% to GDP, 36 million units provide employment to 80 million people**. Sector has huge potential to address structural problems (including crucial for Make in India). Recent initiatives -
        
        1. Udyog Aadhar Memorandum - **UAM scheme Sep-15 to promote ease of doing business.** Online entrepreneurs can get a UA number, ease of doing business

    5. Steel industry - crude steel production India is no. 3 behind China and Japan. Global prices fell in 2015 leading to surge of cheap imports push to India, hitting domestic industry. India increased custom duty, anti dumping duty. Currently, it's a growing sector with annual capacity going from 125 mt in 2017 to 300 mt in 2030. Increasing urbanization will sustain the demand as economy expands.
    6. Aluminum industry - global prices dropped, and China's excess capacity keep price pressure high.
    7. Apparel and footwear sectors have high scope of providing growth, exports and broader social transformation (along the lines of other East Asian economy). Indian economy has comparative disadvantages in the terms of **(1) logistics (2) labor regulation (3) tax and tariff policies (4) export markets (LDC enjoy zero taxes) (5) specific challenges** (cattle for slaughter not easily available).
    8. Ease of doing business - Doing Business report by World Bank Group since 2003. Has 11 sub-indices affecting life of a business. **Score is distance to frontier - distance to frontier score helps assess the absolute level of regulatory performance over time. It measures the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best performance observed** on each of the indicators across all economies. Improving ease of doing business

        6. **Faster and easier exit norm**s, funding support, research parks such as IIT-M.
    11. Indian infrastructure - 3 sectors which are universally categorized: **power, transportation and communication**. Infrastructure bottlenecks are constraint in achieving higher growth for the economy. Funding to be provided both by govt and private (domestic and foreign).
        
        1. **UDAY scheme** - launched Nov 15, for financial and operational turnaround of DISCOMs and to ensure sustainable permanent solution. DISCOMs debt trapped due to legacy issues. Aggregate Technical and Commercial losses (AT&C) as high as 22%. (1) Improve operational efficiencies (LED bulbs, reduce AT&C) (2) reduction in cost of power (coal linkage rationalization, coal swaps bw plants, supply of washed and crushed coal) (3) reduction in interest costs (4) enforcing financial discipline
        2. UJALA (National LED program) - launched Jan 15. **Domestic lighting and street lighting.** Leading to reduction of 20k MW demand with monetary savings of 45k crore to local bodies, CO2 emission down, Make in India
        3. National Smart Grid Mission - (2013) were being carried out through **India Smart Grid Task Force (ISGTF) and India Smart Grid Forum (ISGF) since 2010** under Ministry of Power. Smart grid is an electrical grid with **automation, communication and IT systems that can monitor power flows** from points of generation to points of consumption and control the power flow or curtail the load to match generation on real-time basis. It involves **two-way communication among the generating units**, **control centers** of distribution utilities and **consumers**.
    
    Indian power sector is also plagued with **inadequate investments over decades** towards system improvement works, resulting in **unplanned extension of distribution lines, overloading of systems such as transformers**. All these are technical losses. Commercial losses include **low metering efficiency, theft and pilferage**. Dec-14 Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) launched, centrally sponsored scheme, - reduction of AT&C losses, establishment of IT enabled energy accounting / auditing system, improvement in billed energy based on metered consumption
    
    13. Indian Railways - initiatives taken

    15. Improving urban infrastructure - Smart Cities, Swachh Bharat Mission, HRIDAY, AMRUT, Housing For All 2022. Gurgaon vs Jamshedpur will be a good study in contrast.
    16. Some PPP models
        
        1. BOT-Toll - **non cost sharing, bid given to player offering maximum revenue** to govt. Private player to cover all risks. Govt only provides regulatory clearances. Undue litigation and delays made this unviable.
        2. BOT-Annuity - **toll collection responsibility of govt** and an annuity given to private player in lieu of building, maintaining and operating. **Risk with land acquisition, cost overrun continues.**
        3. EPC - Engineer, procure, construct. Construct the road at lowest cost, **rest all responsibility lies with govt.** But overall lower expectation from private party and hence not PPP in true sense.
        4. HAM - **mix of EPC and BOT Annuity**. Project cost bw 40:60 govt : private. Annuity payment structure means that the **developers aren’t taking traffic risk.** CCEA approved in Jan 16.
        5. Swiss Challenge - flexible model. One **bidder submits proposal which is in public domain.** Several other bidders improve upon the original proposal and bid. If original bidder can't match counter, goes to counter bidder.
    17. Petroleum sector -
        
        1. Should be included in GST, cess collections to support construction of gas pipelines. **Coal bed methane and shale oil/gas** are some new methods of exploring energy.
    18. Renewable energy
        
        1. India is targeting 175 GW by 2022 (solar 100 GW and wind 60W, 10 & 5 from biomass & small hydro). Major steps taken are
            
            1. Solar rooftop (**grid connected rooftop systems** under National Solar Mission.
            2. 25 solar parks and ultra mega solar power projects, solar pumps for irrigation. **Surya Mitra scheme (by NISE) to create 50k trained personnel till 2020.**
        2. India has 23 GW installed capacity in wind energy. National Offshore Wind Energy Policy 2015 to exploit 7600 km vast coastline for development of wind energy in Indian EEZ.
10. Services
    
    1. Service sector has emerged as the **most dynamic sector of world economy,** contributing almost **2/3 of world gross value added,** half of world employment, 20% of global trade and more than half of FDI flows.
    2. India's service sector is growing at **almost 8%, tripling in export value to $150b** in 2015 from 2005.
    3. India has bilateral FTA in services with **Singapore, S Korea (CEPA), Japan, Malaysia and ASEAN.** ￼
11. Financial markets

        4. NPA - loan considered NPA if not serviced **for 1 term of 90 days.** Different for agriculture - tied with period of concerned crop. **Short term such as paddy, jowar, bajra - 2 crops seasons**. **Long term is 1 crop season from due date.**
        
        |   |   |
        |---|---|
        |**Sub standard**|**NPA for <18 months**|
        |**Doubtful**|**NPA for >18 months**|
        |**Loss assets**|**Loss identified but not written off**|
        
        NPAs started increased after RBI conducted Asset Quality Review in March 2016. (1) Almost 9% loans were NPA with **80% of NPA in PSB** where NPA was 12% (2) 40% of debt with companies with interest coverage ratio of <1, **not enough earning to pay even interest on loans.**
        
        7. Resolution of NPAs - steps till
            
            1. 5/25 refinancing - **allows banks to extend long-term loans of 20-25 years to match the cash flow of projects**, while refinancing them every five or seven years. **For infrastructure and 8 core industries.**
            2. Asset Reconstruction Companies - were introduced under SARFAESI Act as specialists to resolve burden of NPAs, but no instrumental help

        8. Capital Adequacy Ratio - **came from Basel Accord 1988 of Bank of International Settlements (BIS).** Purpose is to **ensure financial institutions have enough capital** on account to meet obligations and meet unexpected losses
            
            1. CAR = **Total of Tier 1 & Tier 2 capitals / Risk Weighted Assets.**
            2. Basel II gave Tier 1 capital - which can absorb losses **without bank being required to cease trading.** Core measure of bank's financial strength, equity capital and disclosed reserves ￼Tier 2 capital - absorb losses in **event of winding up and some protection to depositors,** measure of strength from regulator's point of view. ￼Tier 3 capital - **used to meet market, commodities, and foreign currency risk.** To qualify as Tier 3 capital, assets must be limited to 250% of bank's tier 1 capital, be unsecured & subordinated.
            3. CRAR came to India in 1992. **Current regulatory requirement is 9%.**
        9. Basel III provisions aim to **improve quantity and quality of the capital** - restrict inclusion of items such as **deferred tax assets (but RBI has allowed to be added to tier 1)**, mortgage servicing rights and investments in financial institution to 15% of common equity. **Norms are 10.5% by 1 Jan 2019 6+2+2.5 across 3 tiers**.
    7. Stock of money #important
        
        1. M0 = currency in circulation + bankers' deposit with RBI + other deposits of RBI - **reserve money**

        3. M2 = M1 + savings deposits of post office savings bank (narrow)
        4. M3 = M2 + Time deposits with banks - **broad money & money supply**
        5. M4 = M3 + all deposits with post office savings bank (excluding NSC)
        6. **Money multiplier is ratio of M3/M0**
    
    RBI **issued currency notes is reserve money** (which is net credit to govt/banks/SCB + forex + govt currency liability to public + net non-monetary liability of RBI)￼RBI has to hold 200 cr worth of **gold (115 cr) and foreign currency** and can issue currency to any extent - called **Minimum Reserve System (followed since 1957).**
    
    9. Non-resident Indian deposits
        
        1. **Foreign currency non-resident bank account** - repatriation of funds permitted

        2. Out of pocket expenditure for health is high at 70%, only 15% population covered with pre-payment.
        3. Micro insurance (sum assured <50k) - registered NGOs, SHGs, MFIs.
    9. Insurance penetration is defined as ratio of **premium underwritten to GDP.** Insurance density is ratio of **premium underwritten to total population**.
    10. Why low penetration

15. External Sector in India
    
    1. All economic activities of an economy **taking place in foreign currency fall in external sector**. Total **foreign currencies possessed by an economy** at a point of time is its foreign reserve. Forex = currency + gold reserves + SDRs + Reserve Tranche in IMF. India has almost $400b in Dec 2017, excluding gold ($28b)
    2. RBI targets neither a particular exchange rate nor foreign exchange reserves. Only intervenes to **reduce volatility in forex market**. China has largest reserves ($3tn) and hence has become de facto lender of last resort to govts in financial trouble. When RBI purchases dollar in spot, **leads to infusion of rupee into the system (inflation)**. Hence RBI converts spots into forwards (direct cost because of forward premium). **Returns from dollar assets are negligible.**
    3. India's external debt is **$496b in Dec 2017**. **Govt share is 20%. USD denominated debt is 56%. Long term debt is almost 85%.** Managed exchange rate is a hybrid or mixture of fixed and flexible exchange rate systems in which govt attempts to affect exchange rate directly by buy/sell or **indirectly by changing interest rates on foreign currency accounts or FDI**
    4. Indian currency was linked with **Pound Sterling from 1928-48.** After IMF, India shifted to **fixed currency system** to maintain rupee's external value in terms of gold or USD. In 1975, RBI started **determining rupee's exchange rate with respect to basket of world currencies**. In 1992-93 India moved to float currency regime with its own method of dual exchange rate. **One is official rate and other is market rate** (latter affects the former).
    5. Trade balance - monetary difference of **total export and import of an economy in one financial year.** Depreciation/appreciation means domestic currency loses/gains its value in front of foreign currency (in floating system). Devaluation/revaluation is decrease/increase of foreign exchange rate by the govt.
    6. Current account - maintained by govt in which foreign currency transactions are recorded. **India had surplus account only for 3 years (2000-03)**. **There is no deficit/surplus in capital account.**
    7. Balance of Payment - Net outcome of current and capital accounts of an economy. **If positive, added to forex. If negative, forex reduced.** Negative BoP is unfavorable for an economy if it doesn't have means to fill the gap. **BoP crisis is when forex not capable to meet the gap.**
    8. Convertibility - economy might allow **currency full or partial convertibility in current and capital accounts**. If domestic currency is allowed to convert into foreign currency for **all current/capital account purposes** it is case of full current/capital account convertibility. Issue of currency convertibility is concerned with **OUTFLOW only.**
        
        1. **Current account today is fully convertible, since 1994.** Full amount of forex to be made available at official exchange rate. **India was obliged to do so as per Article VIII of IMF.**
        2. Capital account - after **Tarapore Committee (1997) India has been moving in direction of full convertibility but with required precautions.**
            
            1. Indian corporates are allowed full convertibility in automatic route up to **$500m overseas per year**
            2. Allowed to **prepay ECBs loan up to $500m a year**
            3. Individuals can **invest up to $250k abroad a year**
            4. Unlimited amount of gold can be imported (duties paid!).
        3. LERMS - **Liberalized Exchange Rate Mechanism System** was operationalized from 1993. India **delinked** currency from fixed currency system and moved to floating and dual exchange system.
        4. NEER - Nominal effective exchange rate is **weighted avg of exchange rates** before currencies of major trading partners
        5. REER - Real effective exchange rate is **weight of inflation adjusted** NEER
        6. **Extended Fund Facility** - is service provided **by IMF to member countries so they can raise any amount of forex to tide over BoP crisis** but on conditions of **structural reforms.** First agreement of its kind signed with India in 1981-82
    9. IMF conditions
        
        1. Devaluation of **rupee by 22%** (21 to 27). Drastic custom duty roll back (from **130% to 30%)**. Excise **increase by 20% to neutralize flow loss** of custom revenue. Govt **expenditure cut by 10%.**
        2. These were vehemently opposed by Indian corporate sector and opposition but its positive effects were there to see by end of decade
    10. Hard currency - international currency in which highest faith is shown. **USD, Euro, Yen and GBP. Yuan added in 2015 to SDR.**
        
        1. Soft currency - **easily available in any economy in its forex market**
        2. Hot currency - term of forex market and is **temporary name for any hard currency which is exciting the economy** (USD for SE Asia in 1997)
        3. Heated currency - domestic currency under **pressure of depreciation**
        4. Cheap currency - Keynesian term. **If govt starts re-purchasing its bond before maturities and the money which flows into economy**. Period of low interest rate.
        5. Dear currency - opposite of cheap currency. **Govt issues bonds and money flows from public to govt.** Period of higher interest rate.
    11. Special Economic Zone - policy announced in 2000, **SEZ Act in 2005.** To develop export hubs in country. After SEZ Act, **Export Processing Zone (EPZ) and Export Oriented Units (EOU) open to conversion.**
    12. GAAR - General Anti Avoidance Rules - **originally proposed Direct Tax Code 2010 - targeted at transactions specifically to avoid taxes**. Objective of GAAR is to codify the **doctrine of 'substance over form'** where REAL intention of parties and purpose of an arrangement is taken into account, **irrespective of legal structure.** Any one of below -
        
        1. Arrangement creates rights and obligations **not** **at arm's length**
        2. Results in **misuse or abuse of provisions of tax laws**
        3. **Lacks commercial** substance
        4. **Not carried out in bona fide** manner
    13. Explain the trend of India's exports and imports and FDI and FPI?
    14. New steps to promote foreign trade?
    15. India has 12 FTAs and 6 PTAs
        
        1. FTA vs CECA - **CECA/CEPA are more comprehensive and ambitious that an FTA in terms of coverage of areas and the type of commitments.** CECA/CEPA looks deeper at the regulatory aspects of trade than an FTA
    16. Foreign Trade Policy 2015-2020
        
        1. Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS) for **export of specified goods to specified markets**
        2. Services exports from India Scheme (SEIS) for **increasing exports of notified services**
    
    Duty credit scrips issued under these two and **goods imported against these are fully transferable.** Rates of rewards 2-5% for MEIS and 3-5% for SEIS.
    
    18. Boosts exports of defense and hi-tech items. E-comm export of some products to get MEIS benefit (up to 25k value).
    19. Trade Facilitation and enhancing ease of doing business through improving governance and cutting red tape
16. International Economic Organizations & India
    
    1. International monetary system refers to **customs, rules, instruments, facilities & org** which facilitate external payments. Two objectives - **maximize flow of foreign trade** and investment AND **equitable distribution of gains** from trade among nations
        
        1. Adjustment - **refers to process by which BoP crisis of nations** of world are corrected.
        2. Liquidity - refers to **amount of foreign currency reserves available** to settle BoP crisis
        3. Confidence - **refers to faith nations of the world** should show that adjustment mechanism of IMS is working adequately and foreign reserves will retain their absolute and relative values.
    2. Bretton woods development - as powerful nations were hopeful of a more stable world order, also anxious for a more **homogenous world financial order after WW2.** Representatives of 44 countries met at Bretton Woods, NH, USA to decide a new international monetary system. **IMF and World Bank (first institution IBRD)** were set up together and are known as Bretton Woods twins.
    3. IMF - came into existence in 1944-45. **Main functions are exchange rate regulation**, **purchasing short term foreign currency liabilities** of the member nations, **allotting SDRs** and bailout to countries in BOP crisis.
        
        1. Board of Governors - **1 governor and 1 alternate governor**. FM / RBI head are ex officio.
        2. Day to day governance - **Board of Executive Directors** consisting of 24 elected members. India ED serves **India, Bangladesh, SL and Bhutan.**
        3. India's quota - **India has 2.64%** and is ranked 8 out of 24 constituencies. **25% of quota to be paid in cash and 75% in securities.** Borrowing can be done after signing **Extended Fund Facility which India signed in 1981-82.**
    4. World Bank - read in international bodies.

Key policies to be followed are: ease of doing business, updating laws, Smart Cities, disinvestment in PSU, Skill India. Initiative based on 4 pillars - new processes, new infrastructure, new sectors and new mindset. Major steps
   

1. Tax structure in India
    
    1. Tax is a mode of **income redistribution.**
        
        1. Incidence of tax - where **tax looks as being imposed is incidence of ta**x.
        2. Impact of tax - **point where tax** makes it effect felt
        3. Direct tax - **incidence and impact both at same point** is direct tax
        4. Indirect tax - **incidence and impact at different point** is indirect tax
    2. Three methods of taxation -
        
        1. Progressive taxation - increasing rates of tax for **increasing value on which tax is imposed.** E.g. Indian tax. Being poor is rewarded and being rich is punished. **Most popular and populist method.**
        2. Regressive taxation - decreasing rates of tax for increasing value. E.g. to **promote growth and development** of small scale industries, higher slabs to have lower excise duty.
        3. Proportional tax - fixed rate of tax for every level of income, neutral from rich or poor perspective. Not used as an independent method.
    3. Broad consensus on 5 principles of a good tax system
        
        1. **Fairness** - horizontal equity (similar level of people pay same) and vertical equity (better off people pay more).
        2. **Efficiency** - good tax system raises revenue with least cost on taxpayers and least interference on allocation of resources. E.g. tax on pollution/smoking serves broad social purpose (this is double dividend of tax)
        3. **Administrative simplicity** - helps check in evasion as well
        4. **Flexibility** - scope of desirable modifications in it if need arises
        5. **Transparency** - how much tax payers and paying and how it's being utilized
    4. Three methods of expenditure - progressive, regressive, proportional. **Progressive method of both taxation and expenditure is widely used by countries.**
    5. Value Added Tax - method of tax collection.
        
        1. Tax **collected at every stage of value addition**, either by production or distribution is known as value added tax. **No chance of imposing tax on tax which takes place in non-VAT method**. It doesn't have cascading effect on price of goods and doesn't increase inflation. Highly suitable for economy like India
        2. Need of VAT in India at **THAT point (1991)-**
            
            1. Due to single point collection, **indirect tax was price increasing**
            2. **Uniformity to create single Indian market**
            3. Counter **large scale tax evasion**
            4. Reduce **complexity** of state level taxes
        3. **Chelliah Committee** in 1991, 92 & 93 reports and **Vijay Kelkar Committee** in 2002
            
            1. In 1992, **central govt started CENVAT.** At state level, excise and sales were to be merged but couldn't happen. **Sales tax govt converted to VAT while excise remained.**
        4. Was fully implemented in India **across all states by 2008-09. Majority of states saw revenue increase.**
    6. Goods and Service Tax - single national tax by **integrating the indirect taxes.** Comprehensive, **multi-stage, destination-based tax that is levied on every value addition**. Taxes subsumed
        
        1. Central - CENVAT (excise), additional excise duties, service tax, **CVD**
        2. State - **VAT, entertainment tax** (other than tax levied by local bodies), luxury tax, central sales tax, octroi and entry tax, purchase tax, taxes on lottery, betting & gambling.
        3. Concept of **'declared goods of special importance' dropped**
        4. **Electricity, alcohol for human consumption, and petrol and allied products, real estate** - are kept out of GST as of now
        5. States to get **compensation for revenue loss for 5 years. Base year 2015-16 and 14% growth rate**
        6. No manual filing of taxes, **but by GST Network (non profit, non-govt company registered by center and states)**
    7. What is additional excise duty? Imposed and **collected by Centre and handed over to states, NOT a form of excise duty.** Levied on tobacco textile, sugar in lieu of state's sales tax on them.
        
        1. What was Central Sales tax? **Origin based non-rebatable tax.** Inconsistent with concept of VAT. Subsumed in GST
        2. CVD - duties that are imposed in **order to counter the negative impact of import subsidies to protect domestic producers** are called countervailing duties.
    8. Commodities Transaction Tax - introduced in 2013-14, only for **non-agricultural** **commodity futures at 0.01%** (= STT on equity futures). Transactions in commodity derivatives declared to be **made non-speculative**
        
        1. Securities Transaction Tax - type of financial transaction tax on domestic stock exchanges. **It's a direct tax.** With this, LTCG was made 0. **STT not applicable on preference shares, govt securities, bonds, debentures, currency derivatives, mutual funds other than equity oriented, gold ETF -** **LTCG will apply in these cases**. ￼**Takeover, buyback, delisting, off-market share transactions also doesn't come under STT**
    9. Capital gains tax - direct tax and applies on sale of all assets
        
        1. Short term capital gain - **sold within 36 months of owning it**. Rate of tax is similar to income tax slab. In case of shares, **MF, units of UTI/zero coupon bonds, rate is 15%**

    13. 14th Finance Commission
        
        1. Constituted in 2013, under **Y. V. Reddy and will apply for period 2015-20**
            
            1. Principles of distribution of net proceeds of taxes
            2. Principles governing **grant-in-aid out of CFI**
            3. Measures to **increase CFI of state to supplement** panchayat/municipalities resources
            4. Review **state of finance,** deficit, debt levels of union and states
        2. Commission is required to take **population of census 1971** for determination of devolution of taxes and grant in aids. However demographic changes can be taken into consideration
        3. Major recommendations of 14th FC
            
            1. Radically enhanced share of states in **central divisible pool from 32% to 42% - biggest ever increase**
            2. Proposed **new horizontal formula** for horizontal distribution among states
            3. Move country towards **fiscal federalism, sustainable to Centre by reducing central assistance to states.**
            4. Broadly **special category states are biggest gainers** of this move
    14. Concepts related to FC
        
        1. **Tax devolution -** advising a formula to distribute the union tax proceeds bw Centre and states
        2. **Divisible pool -** portion of gross tax revenue which is distributed bw Centre and states. Consists of all taxes, **except surcharges and cess levied for specific purpose**. New article 270 (80th amendment) provides for it.
        3. Grants in aid - prerequisite is **assessment of needs of the states: budget, effort by states, equalizing standard basic services,** any obligation of national concern, further any beneficent service. 10th FC was first to recommend grants for rural and urban local bodies.
        4. Fiscal capacity - also called **income distance. Measured by per capita GSDP as a proxy for distance bw states in tax capacity**. Tax-to-GSDP ratio to determine fiscal capacity bw states. It’s simply the **ability to generate revenues**. As majority of the revenue of governments around the world is through taxes, **Tax to GDP ratio is often taken as proxy for the fiscal capacity of a government**.
        5. Fiscal discipline - Incentive to states to manage finances prudently.
    15. Direct tax reforms
        
        1. Direct Tax Code 2013 was **fully complied with during 2016-17 which replace 50 year old archaic direct tax law of India.** Aimed at equitable and effective tax regime, voluntary compliance and dispute reduction.
    16. Income and consumption trends in India (Total tax = 10 lakh direct + 9 lakh indirect)
        
        1. India's **tax to GDP ratio is very low and proportion of direct tax to indirect tax is not optimal** from social justice POV.
            
            1. Indirect taxes are said to be regressive in nature as they do not distinguish between poor and rich, and therefore, higher proportion of indirect taxes in total tax collection is not considered ideal
            2. proportion of direct tax in total tax collections has been falling for the last couple of years (at 50% now)
        2. India is largely a **tax non-compliant society (65m tax payers),** when too many evade taxes burden of their share falls on those who are honest and compliant
            
            1. combined tax-GDP ratio for the center and states is estimated to be around 16.5% as per 2016-17 budget. For the center, the tax GDP ratio was 11.3% as per 2016-17 budget and the 2017-18 budget also makes the same estimate. far less than 34.3% average for OECD members￼
2. Public Finance
    
    1. Referenced in **Arthashastra** **of Kautilya.** Budget is annual financial statement of income and expenditure of govt. **Article 112 of Constitution makes provisions for presentation of annual financial statement in Parliament before new fiscal year**. 3 sets of data - **actual (-1), provisional estimates (0) and budgetary estimates (+1).**
    2. Total expenditure incurred by govt is classified into 2 segments - **capital expenditure and revenue expenditure** (from 2017-18 fiscal year). Why not plan and non-plan expenditure?
        
        1. **Asset creation is plan and maintenance of these assets is classified as non-plan expenditure**. In cases of austerity measures, **critical non-plan expenditures gets axed first.** Biggest items of non-plan expenditure are **interest payments and debt servicing, defense expenditure and subsidies.** 
        2. Outcome budgeting was introduced - but kept non-plan expenditure out of its purview. Outcome based budgeting is a **practice of suggesting and listing of estimated outcomes** of each programmes or schemes designed.
    3. Revenue - every accrual of money to govt from revenue or non-revenue source is receipt. Their sum is total receipts.
        
        1. Revenue receipt - **tax revenue (direct & indirect taxes)** and **non-tax revenue** (profits & dividends, interests, fiscal services, general services, fees & penalties, grants)
        2. Revenue expenditure - **they are of consumptive kind and do not involve creation of productive assets.** E.g. salaries, subsidies, defense, law & order, social services.
        3. Revenue deficit - when **total revenue receipts are less than the total revenue expenditure.** Effective revenue deficit means **RD excluding GoCA (grants for creation of capital assets) to states**, e.g. PDGSY
    4. Capital budget - part of budget which **deals with receipts and expenditures** of capital by govt. It also incorporates **transactions in the Public Account.**
        
        1. Capital receipts - **all non-revenue receipts of govt are known as capital receipts.** For investment purposes and supposed to be spent on plan-development by govt. E.g. **loan recovery (principal only)**, borrowings by govt, other receipts (PF, govt bonds sold)
        2. Capital expenditure -loans disbursals by govt, **loans repayable by govt, plan expenditure, capital expenditure on defense, general services** (railways, post), repayment of liabilities
        3. Capital deficit - no such term.
    5. Fiscal deficit - when **balance of govt's total receipts (revenue + capital receipts) and total expenditure (revenue + capital expenditure) is negative**. Means govt is spending beyond its means.
        
        1. **Primary deficit - fiscal deficit excluding interest payments.**
        2. Monetized deficit - Also known as the **'net reserve bank credit to the government'**, it is that part of the government deficit which is **financed solely by borrowing from the RBI.**
        ![Term of Financing Long tenn financing (a+b) Short term financing (c+d+e) Types of Financing a) Long-tenn financing other than RBI b) Long-term financing from RBI c) Sh01t-tenn financing from RBI ](Exported%20image%2020250424103457-1.tiff)4. Union **budget in India has never been presented as a surplus budget. Uttaranchal budget was 2007-08 was a surplus budget**.
    6. Deficit financing - **started by USA in 1930s and was able to get out of Great Depression**. **India tried it in 1969 and became routine phenomenon until it became unsustainable** as it was not based on sound fundamentals of economics.
        
        1. **External aids - best money to fulfil a govt's deficit requirement.** Grants are even better (free of interest or payments).
        2. External borrowing - **comparatively cheaper and long term**. Benefits - bring in foreign exchange, **negates crowding out effect**
        3. Internal borrowing - **hampers investment prospects** of public and corporate sector
        4. Printing currency - last resort. **Cannot fund foreign currency expenditure**. Cons - **increases inflation, pressure of upward revision in wages**.
    7. Composition of fiscal deficit -
        
        1. **Fiscal deficit with a surplus revenue budget or zero revenue budget is most suitable.** All expenditure towards capital (asset creation)
        2. Deficit requirements for **lower revenue expenditure and higher capital expenditures** are next best
        3. Major part for revenue expenditure or fully for it - worst part
    8. Fiscal policy - policy of govt with regard to level of **govt purchases, transfers and tax structures**. Keynes linked **fiscal policy and economic performance.** Fiscal policy denotes the **use of taxes and govt expenditure to achieve macroeconomic goals**
        
        1. Taxes have a direct bearing on disposable incomes of people; directly affect savings of individuals, families and firms which affect investment; prices of goods and services
        2. Govt expenditure is on **productive asset** creation or transfer payments
    9. Deficit Financing in India phases
        
        1. First 1947-70: **no concept of deficit financing but budgetary deficits.** India tried to borrow from internal and external sources but unable to meet target. **Increasing tax collections led to tax evasion and rise of corruption.** Heavy borrowings from RBI and nationalization of banks. Establishing PSUs and providing govt jobs led to increase in revenue expenditure.
        2. Second 1970-91: **nationalization policy and expansion of PSU at the time rest of SE Asia accepted capitalism and privatization** AND China realized that investment in govt enterprises is loss of money. **PSUs were not driven by profit motive and overtime became centers of intentional losses and institutionalized center of corruption.** Majority of plan expenditure turned out to be non-economic.
        3. Third 1991-onwards: **economy moved from govt dominance to private dominance.**
    10. Why has govt not been able to check menace of fiscal deficit
        
        1. **Political factor** - subsidies and interest groups along with vested interests of those in power and those aspiring for it
        2. **Institutional factor** - administration of India has traditionally given more importance to reporting, accounting, supervising and monitoring rather than actual production and delivery of goods and services
        3. **Ethical factor** - govt must function as protector of the poor and provider for jobs
    11. Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act 2003
        
        1. Fiscal policy provides **stability and predictability to policy regime and ensures that national resources** are allocated in terms of their defined priorities through tax transfer mechanism.
        2. Specify annual targets for **reduction of fiscal deficit and revenue deficit**. FD by 3.5% per annum and RD by 0.5% per annum. _May exceed targets only on grounds of national security, calamity or exceptional grounds._
        3. Govt **cant borrow from RBI except by Ways and Means Advances**
        4. All states and UTs have passed their fiscal responsibility acts (FRAs).
    12. Limiting govt expenditure - three ways from around the world
        
        1. Central bank **legally bound to ensure that money creation** doesn't increase the rate of inflation target
        2. **Upper limit on govt's power to create deficits**
        3. Growth in money supply is **not allowed to exceed growth in foreign assets**
    13. Fiscal consolidation in India
        
        1. Cutting revenue deficits - cutting down burden of salaries, pensions and PFs; cutting down of subsidies; interest burden; limiting budgetary support to PSUs; general services to be **motivated towards profits with subsidy to needy only**
        2. Increasing revenue receipts - **tax reforms initiated**; disinvestment and privatization; **deploying forex reserve for returns**; state govt allowed to go for market borrowing
        3. Govt borrowing - WMA scheme (from 1997) was **designed to meet temporary mismatches in the receipts and payments of the government.** This facility can be availed by the government if it needs immediate cash from the RBI. The **WMA is to be vacated after 90 days. Interest rate for WMA is currently charged at the repo rate.** The limits for WMA are mutually decided by the RBI and the Government. ￼**RBI is not prime subscriber to govt securities.**
    14. Zero base budgeting (ZBB) - is a method of budgeting in which **all expenses must be justified for each new period****, originated in USA** under Jimmy Carter. Zero-based budgeting starts from a "zero base," and every function within an organization is analyzed for its needs and costs. 3 principles
        
        1. Should we spend? How much should we spend? Where should we spend?
        2. Limits - expenditures in economy over which **govt doesn't have scrutiny** (charged expenditure in India); certain public services **defy cost-benefit** analysis; scope for **emergence of one single hegemonic entity** which will approve programmes based on ZBB
    15. Charged expenditure - public expenditure **beyond voting power** of Parliament and directly withdrawn from Consolidated Fund of India. E.g. salary of President, Speakers, Judges of SC/HC
    16. **General Financial Rules (GFR) are rules and orders dealing with matters involving public finances**. General Financial Rules were issued for the first time in 1947 bringing together in one place all existing orders and instructions pertaining to financial matters. Modified several times, latest in 2017.
    17. Types of budget -
        
        1. Golden Rule of public finance - govt should **borrow only to invest and no finance current spending**
        2. Balanced budget - **zero revenue deficit** is balanced budget
        3. Gender budgeting - allocation of funds and responsibilities **on basis of gender is gender budgeting. India did it in 2006-07**
    18. Cut motions
        
        1. Token cut - 'reduce the demand by Rs 100' to express a **specific grievance** within the sphere of responsibility of central govt
        2. Economy cut - 'reduce the demand by a **specified amount'**
        3. Disapproval of policy cut - 'reduce the demand to Re 1' - **disapproval of policy underlying the demand**
        4. Guillotine - process in which Speakers **puts all outstanding demands made by budget directly to vote in the House to cut short the discussion on budget**. Has been used continuously by govts in India to pass the budget
    19. Trilemmas - Mundell's impossible trinity. Country cannot maintain simultaneously goals of (1) **free capital flows (2) fixed exchange rate (3) independent monetary policy**
    20. **Computerization of State Treasuries was put in mission mode under National e-Governance Plan. Centrally sponsored scheme.**
    21. Expenditure Management Commission 2013 -
        
        1. Constituted through a resolution, it's a recommendation body with the primary responsibility of **suggesting major expenditure reforms that will enable the government to reduce and manage its fiscal deficit** at more sustainable levels.

3. Sustainability & Climate Change
    
    1. As per WMO, **2016 was warmest year** with temperature above 1 C above pre-industrial era **owing to El Nino and warming caused by GHGs.**
    2. Emissions of USA in last 40-50 years have been **6 times of India (40 Gt)**. **India's per capita emission is 2 ton vs 17 ton of USA.**
    3. Green finance - no universal definition - can include clean energy, energy efficiency, green buildings. World Bank has set up informal _Sustainable Banking Network_ to promote sustainable lending practices.
        
        1. India had created a corpus called **National Clean Energy Fund (NEF) in 2011 out of cess on coal.** Non lapsable under Public Account.
        2. 6 banks had issued **green bonds in India to fund renewable energy projects**
    
    Many developed countries are now camouflaging official development assistance as climate finance.
