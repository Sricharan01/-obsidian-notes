Class 11￼

2. Indian economy on eve of independence
    
    1. Sole purpose of the British colonial rule in India was to **reduce the country to being a raw material supplier** for Great Britain’s own rapidly expanding modern industrial base. Before advent of British rule, India was particularly well known for its handicraft industries in the fields of cotton and silk textiles, metal and precious stone works etc.
    2. Among the notable estimators of India's GDP and per capita income to gauge British exploitation, **Dadabhai Naoroji, V.K.R.V. Rao are people whose estimates during the colonial period** was considered very significant. Country’s growth of aggregate real output during the first half of the 20th century **was less than 2% coupled** with a meagre 1/2% growth in per capita output per year.
    3. Agriculture sector - India’s economy under the British colonial rule **remained fundamentally agrarian** — about 85% of the country’s population l**ived mostly in villages and derived livelihood** directly or indirectly from agriculture
        
        1. Continued to experience stagnation and, frequently, unusual deterioration. Agricultural **productivity became low though, in absolute terms, the sector experienced some growth due to the expansion of the aggregate area** under cultivation.
        2. Despite some progress made in irrigation, India’s agriculture was **starved of investment in terracing, flood-control, drainage and desalinization of soil.** While a small section of farmers changed their **cropping pattern from food crops to commercial crops**, a large section of tenants, small farmers and sharecroppers neither had resources and technology nor had incentive to invest in agriculture
    4. Industrial sector - India **could not develop a sound industrial base** under the colonial rule. Even as the country’s world famous handicraft industries declined, no corresponding **modern industrial base was allowed to come up** to take pride of place so long enjoyed by the former
        
        1. Policy of **systematically deindustrializing India** - aim was two-fold. First, to reduce India to the **status of a mere exporter** of important raw materials for the upcoming modern industries in Britain. Second, to turn India into a **sprawling market** for the finished products from Britain.
        2. During the second half of the 19th century, **modern industry began to take root in India** but its progress remained very slow. Initially, this development was confined to the **setting up of cotton and jute textile mills**. The cotton textile mills, mainly dominated by Indians, were located in the western parts of the country, namely, Maharashtra and Gujarat, while the **jute mills dominated by the foreigners were mainly concentrated in Bengal.** Subsequently, the iron and steel industries began coming up in the beginning of the 20th century.
        3. **Hardly any capital goods industry** to help promote further industrialization in India. Capital goods industry means industries which can **produce machine tools** which are, in turn, used for producing articles for current consumption
    5. Foreign Trade - **restrictive policies of commodity production**, **trade and tariff** pursued by the colonial government adversely affected the structure, composition and volume of India’s foreign trade.
        
        1. India became an **exporter of primary products** such as raw silk, cotton, wool, sugar, indigo, jute etc. and an **importer of finished consumer** goods like cotton, silk and woolen clothes and capital goods like light machinery produced in the factories of Britain. For all practical purposes, Britain maintained a **monopoly control over India’s exports and imports.**
        2. Export surplus **did not result in any flow of gold or silver into India.** Rather, this was **used to make payments for the expenses incurred by offices** set up by the colonial government in Britain, **expenses on war**, again fought by the British government, and the **import of invisible items**, all of which led to the drain of Indian wealth.
    6. Demographics - various social development indicators were also not quite encouraging.
        
        1. Overall literacy level was **less than 16%. Out of this, the female literacy level was at a negligible low of about 7%.** Public health facilities were either unavailable to large chunks of population or, when available, were highly inadequate
        2. Infant mortality rate was quite alarming—**about 218 per thousand.** Life expectancy was also **very low—44 years.**
    7. Infra - Under the colonial regime, **basic infrastructure such as railways, ports, water transport, posts and telegraphs did develop**. However, the real motive behind this development was not to provide basic amenities to the people **but to sub serve various colonial interests.**
    8. Summary - By the time India won its independence, the impact of the two-century long British colonial rule was already showing on all aspects of the Indian economy.
        
        1. Agricultural sector was already **saddled with surplus labor and extremely low productivity.**
        2. Industrial sector was **crying for modernization,** diversification, capacity building and increased public investment.
        3. Foreign trade was **oriented to feed the Industrial Revolution in Britain**. Infrastructure facilities, including the famed railway network, needed upgradation, expansion and public orientation.
        4. Prevalence of **rampant poverty and unemployment required welfare orientation** of public economic policy
3. Planning
    
    1. Intermediaries such as **zamindars, jagirdars et al** **merely collected rent** **from the actual tillers of the soil** without contributing towards improvements on the farm. The low productivity of the agricultural sector **forced India to import food from abroad.** Equity in **agriculture called for land reforms** which primarily refer to change in the ownership of landholdings (land to the tiller).
    2. **Land ceiling** was another policy to promote equity in the agricultural sector. This means fixing the maximum size of land which could be owned by an individual. The purpose of land ceiling was to **reduce the concentration of land ownership in a few hands.**
        
        1. Abolition of intermediaries meant that some 200 lakh tenants came into direct contact with the government — they were thus **freed from being exploited by the zamindars**. The ownership conferred on tenants gave them the incentive to increase output and this contributed to growth in agriculture
        2. **Poorest of the agricultural labourers (such as sharecroppers and landless labourers) did not benefit from land reforms**
    3. Green Revolution - stagnation in agriculture **during the colonial rule was permanently broken by the green revolution.** This refers to the large increase in production of food grains resulting from the use of **high yielding variety (HYV) seeds** especially for wheat and rice.
        
        1. Government provided loans at a **low interest rate to small farmers** and subsidized fertilizers so that small farmers could also have access to the needed inputs. Since the small farmers **could obtain the required inputs, the output on small farms equaled the output on large farms** in the course of time. As a result, the green revolution benefited the small as well as rich farmers.
    4. Debate over subsidies - One view is that once the **new technology has been widely adopted, subsidies should be phased out.** Moreover big chunk of fertilizer subsidies are cornered by big farmers and industry. Counter view is that small farmers still need the support as **agriculture is risky business in India** and take steps to ensure that only the poor farmers enjoy the benefits
    5. Between 1950 and 1990, proportion of GDP contributed by agriculture declined significantly but not population depending on it (67% in 1950 to 65% by 1990).
        
        1. Industrial sector and the service sector **did not absorb the people working in the agricultural sector.** Many economists call this an **important failure of our policies** followed during 1950-1990
    6. In accordance with the goal of the state controlling the **commanding heights** of the economy, the **Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956** was adopted. This resolution formed the basis of the **Second Five Year Plan, the plan which tried to build the** **basis** **for a** **socialist pattern** **of society.**
        
        1. This resolution classified industries into 3 categories. (i) **exclusively** owned by the state; (ii) industries in which the **private** sector could **supplement** the efforts of the state sector, with the state taking the sole responsibility for starting new units; (iii) remaining industries which were to be in the **private** sector
    7. Small-Scale Industry: In 1955, the **Village and Small-Scale Industries Committee, also called the Karve Committee**, noted the possibility of using small-scale industries for promoting rural development.
        
        1. Production of a **number of products was reserved for the small-scale industry**; the criterion of reservation being the ability of these units to manufacture the goods
    8. Trade was characterized by what is commonly called **import substitution.** This policy aimed at replacing or substituting imports with domestic production. Protection from imports took two forms: **tariffs and quotas.** Tariffs are a tax on imported goods; they make imported goods more expensive and discourage their use. Quotas specify the quantity of goods which can be imported
    9. Effect of Policies on Industrial Development:
        
        1. State enterprises continued to **produce certain goods and services (often monopolizing them)** although this was no longer required. Many public sector firms **incurred huge losses** but continued to function
        2. The excessive regulation of what came to be called **permit license raj prevented certain firms from becoming more efficient.** More time was spent by industrialists in trying to obtain a license or lobby concerned ministries
        3. Due to restrictions on imports, the Indian **consumers had to purchase whatever the Indian producers produced**. The producers were aware that they had a captive market; so they had no incentive to improve the quality of their goods￼
4. LPG Reforms
    
    1. Origin of the **financial crisis can be traced from the inefficient management of the Indian economy in the 1980s.** Development policies required that even though the revenues were very low, the **government had to overshoot its revenue** to meet challenges like unemployment, poverty and population explosion
    2. In the late 1980s, government expenditure began to **exceed its revenue by such large margins** that meeting the expenditure through borrowings became unsustainable.
        
        1. Prices of many **essential goods rose sharply**. Imports grew at a very high rate without matching growth of exports
        2. foreign exchange reserves **declined to a level that was not adequate** to finance imports for more than two weeks. There was also not sufficient foreign exchange to pay the interest that needs to be paid to international lenders.
        3. India approached the **International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)**, popularly known as World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and received **$7 billion as loan to manage the crisis.** For availing the loan, these international agencies **expected India to liberalize** and open up the economy by removing restrictions on the private sector, reduce the role of the government in many areas and **remove trade restrictions between India and other countries.**
    3. India agreed to the conditionality and announced the **New Economic Policy (NEP).** The thrust of the policies was towards creating a **more competitive environment** in the economy and removing the barriers to entry and growth of firms. This set of policies can broadly be classified into two groups: the **stabilization measures and the structural reform measures**
        
        1. Structural reform policies are **long-term measures,** aimed at improving the **efficiency of the economy** and increasing its **international competitiveness** by removing the rigidities in various segments of the Indian economy.
    4. Liberalization - Though a **few measures were introduced in 1980s in areas of industrial licensing**, export-import policy, technology upgradation, fiscal policy and foreign investment, reform policies initiated in **1991 were more comprehensive.**
        
        1. Deregulation of Industrial Sector - Industrial licensing was **abolished for almost all but product categories** — alcohol, cigarettes, hazardous chemicals, industrial explosives, electronics, aerospace and drugs and pharmaceuticals. The only industries which are now reserved for the public sector are **atomic energy generation and railway transport.**
        2. Financial Sector Reforms - reform policies led to the **establishment of private sector banks, Indian as well as foreign**. Foreign investment limit in banks was raised to around 50%. Those banks which fulfil certain conditions have been given freedom to set up new branches **without the approval of the RBI** and rationalize their existing branch networks
        3. Tax Reforms - concerned with the reforms in government’s taxation and public expenditure policies which are collectively known as its fiscal policy. Since 1991, there has been a **continuous reduction in the taxes on individual and corporate incomes** as it was felt that high rates of income tax were an important reason for tax evasion
        4. Foreign Exchange Reforms - **rupee was devalued against foreign currencies.** This led to an increase in the inflow of foreign exchange. Move to market determined exchange rates **based on the demand and supply** of foreign exchange.
        5. Trade and Investment Policy Reforms - liberalization of **trade and investment regime** was initiated to increase international competitiveness of industrial production and also **foreign investments and technology into the economy**. (i) dismantling of quantitative restrictions on imports and exports (ii) reduction of tariff rates and (iii) **removal of licensing** procedures for imports
    5. Privatization - Privatization of the public sector enterprises **by selling off part of the equity of PSEs** to the public is known as disinvestment. The purpose of the sale, according to the government, was mainly to **improve financial discipline and facilitate modernization**
    6. Globalization - outcome of the set of various policies that are aimed at transforming the world towards greater interdependence and integration.
        
        1. **Outsourcing** is one of the important outcomes of the globalization process.
        2. Setting up of **WTO in this period**
    7. Reforms in Agriculture - have **not been able to benefit agriculture**, where the growth rate has been decelerating
        
        1. Sector has been experiencing a number of policy changes such as **reduction in import duties on agricultural products, removal of minimum support price and lifting of quantitative restrictions** on agricultural products; these have adversely affected Indian farmers
    8. Viewed from the Indian context, some studies have stated that the crisis that erupted in the early 1990s was **basically an outcome of the deep-rooted inequalities** in Indian society and the economic reform policies initiated as a response to the crisis by the government, with externally advised policy package, further aggravated the inequalities.￼
5. Poverty
    
    1. Providing **minimum basic needs** to the people and reduction of poverty have been the major aims of independent India. The pattern of development that the successive five year plans envisaged laid emphasis on the upliftment of the poorest of the poor (Antyodaya), **integrating the poor into the mainstream** and achieving a minimum standard of living for all
        
        1. **Starvation and hunger are the key features of the poorest households**. The poor lack basic literacy and skills and hence have **very limited economic opportunities.** Poor people also face unstable employment. Malnutrition is alarmingly high among the poor.
    2. ![Chart 4.2: The Chronic Poor. Transient Poor and Poverty Line (Specifie category) Always poor Usually Poor Churning Poor ](Exported%20image%2020250424103502-0.tiff)
    
    When the number of poor is estimated as the proportion of people **below the poverty line**, it is known as ‘Head Count Ratio’ (22% in 2011)
    
    4. Causes of poverty lie in the **institutional and social factors that mark the life of the poor**. The poor are **deprived of quality education and unable** to acquire skills which fetch better incomes. Also access to health care is denied to the poor. The main victims of caste, religious and other discriminatory practices are poor.
        
        1. Poverty is also explained by general, economy-wide problems, such as (i) low capital formation (ii) lack of infrastructure (iii) lack of demand (iv) pressure of population (v) lack of social/ welfare nets
    5. A large section of the rural poor in India are the **small farmers.** The land that they have is, in general, less fertile and dependent on rains. Their survival **depends on subsistence crops and sometimes on livestock.** With the rapid growth of population and without alternative sources of employment, the **per-head availability of land for cultivation has steadily declined** leading to fragmentation of land holdings.
    6. A large section of **urban poor in India are largely the overflow of the rural poor** who migrate to urban areas in search of employment and a livelihood. Industrialization has not been able to absorb all these people. The **urban poor are either unemployed or intermittently employed as casual laborers.** Casual laborers are among the most vulnerable in society as they have no job security, no assets, limited skills, sparse opportunities and no surplus to sustain them
    7. Indian Constitution and five year plans state **social justice** as the **primary objective of the developmental strategies** of the government.
        
        1. government’s approach to poverty reduction was of three dimensions. The first one is **growth oriented approac**h. It is based on the expectation that the effects of economic growth — rapid increase in gross domestic product and per capita income — would **spread to all sections of society** and will **trickle down** to the poor sections also
        2. incomes and employment for the poor could be raised through the **creation of additional assets and by means of work generation.** This could be achieved through specific poverty alleviation programmes.
        3. third approach to addressing poverty is to provide **minimum basic amenities** to the people. India was among the pioneers in the world to envisage that through public expenditure on s**ocial consumption needs** — provision of food grains at subsidized rates, education, health, water supply and sanitation—people’s living standard could be improved.
    8. Due to **unequal distribution of land and other assets**, the benefits from direct poverty alleviation programmes have been **appropriated by the non-poor**. Government policies have also failed to address the vast majority of vulnerable people who are living on or just above the poverty line. It also reveals that **high growth alone is not sufficient** to reduce poverty. Without the active participation of the poor, successful implementation of any programme is not possible￼
6. Human Capital Formation
    
    1. Societies need **sufficient human capital in the first place** —in the form of competent people who have themselves been **educated and trained** as professors and other professionals
    2. Sources of Human Capital - Investment in **education** is considered as one of the main sources of human capital. Investments in **health, on- the job training, migration and information** are the other sources of human capital formation. They increase income generating capacity of an individual and thus a nation.
        
        1. The concept of **physical capital is the base for conceptualizing human capital.**
    3. Human capital considers **education and health** as a means to increase labor productivity. Human development is based on the idea that education and health are integral to human well-being because only when people have the ability to read and write and the ability to lead a **long and healthy life,** they will be able to make other **choices which they value.**
    4. Expenditure by the government is expressed in two ways (i) as a percentage of ‘total government expenditure’ (ii) as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
        
        1. India's overall allocation to this important sector in the last decade has hovered between **3.5-4% of total expenditure**. In 2017, the figure was 3.7%. This needs to grow, particularly when you compare **India's spends on education is the lowest among peers.**
        2. Elementary education takes a **major share of total education expenditure** and the share of the higher/tertiary education is the least
    5. Education for All — Still a Distant Dream. Though literacy rates for both — adults as well as youth — have increased, still the **absolute number of illiterates** in India is as much as India’s population was at the time of independence.
        
        1. Differences in literacy rates between males and females are **narrowing signifying** a **positive development** in gender equity; still the need to promote education for women in India is imminent for various reasons such as improving economic independence and social status of women and also because **women education makes a favorable impact on fertility rate and health care of women and children.**￼
7. Rural Development
    
    1. Mahatma Gandhi once said that the real progress of India did not mean simply the growth and expansion of industrial urban centers but mainly the development of the villages. This idea of **village development being at the center** of the overall development of the nation is relevant even today
        
        1. It is because more than two-third of India’s population depends on agriculture that is **yet to become productive enough** to provide for them; one-third of rural India still lives in abject poverty. That is the reason why we have to see a developed rural India if our nation has to realize real progress.
    2. Essentially focuses on action for the development of areas that are **lagging behind in the overall development** of the village economy. Decline in public investment since 1991, **Inadequate infrastructure, lack of alternate employment opportunities** in the industry or service sector, increasing casualization of employment etc., further impede rural development
    3. Credit: Growth of rural economy **depends primarily on infusion of capital**, from time to time, to realize higher productivity in agriculture and non-agriculture sectors. // **‘****Kudumbashree****’ is a women-oriented community-based poverty reduction programme being implemented in Kerala**
        
        1. A major change occurred after 1969 when **India adopted social banking and multiagency** approach to adequately meet the needs of rural credit
        2. Green Revolution was a harbinger o**f major changes in the credit system as it led to the diversification of the portfolio** of rural credit towards production oriented lending.
        3. NABARD was set up in **1982 as an apex body** to coordinate the activities of all institutions involved in the **rural financing system**
        4. SHGs have emerged to fill the gap in the formal credit system because the formal credit delivery mechanism ha**s not only proven inadequate but has also not been fully integrated** into the overall rural social and community development
        5. Rural Banking - Rapid expansion of the banking system had a **positive effect on rural farm and non-farm output, income and employment.** Famines became events of the past
        6. Failed to develop a culture of deposit mobilisation - lending to worthwhile borrowers and effective loan recovery. Agriculture loan default rates have been chronically high
    4. Agriculture Market System - Prior to independence, farmers, while selling their produce to traders, suffered from f**aulty weighing and manipulation of accounts**. Farmers who did not have the required information on prices prevailing in markets were often forced to sell at low prices. They **also did not have proper storage facilities** to keep back their produce for selling later at a better price.
        
        1. 1st step was regulation of markets to create **orderly and transparent marketing conditions.** By and large, this policy benefited farmers as well as consumers
        2. 2nd component is provision of **physical infrastructure facilities** like roads, railways, warehouses, godowns, cold storages and processing units.
        3. 3rd cooperative marketing, in **realizing fair prices** for farmers’ products
        4. 4th element is the policy instruments like (i) assurance of minimum support prices (MSP) for agricultural products (ii) maintenance of buffer stocks of wheat and rice by Food Corporation of India and (iii) distribution of food grains and sugar through PDS.
    5. If farmers directly sell their produce to consumers, it increases their incomes. E.g. Apni Mandi (Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan); Hadaspar Mandi (Pune); Rythu Bazars (vegetable and fruit markets in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana) and Uzhavar Sandies (farmers markets in Tamil Nadu)
        
        1. National and multinational fast food chains are increasingly entering into contracts/ alliances with farmers to encourage them to cultivate farm products (vegetables, fruits) of the desired quality
    6. **‘Operation Flood’** - is a system whereby all the farmers can **pool their milk produced according to different grading** (based on quality) and the same is processed and marketed to urban centers through cooperatives.
    7. Presently, fish production from **inland sources contributes about 64% total value of fish production** and the balance 36% from the marine sector (sea and oceans). Today total fish production accounts for 0.8% of total GDP.
    8. Horticulture sector **contributes nearly 1/3 of the value of agriculture output** and 6% GDP to India. India has emerged as a world leader in producing a variety of fruits like mangoes, bananas, coconuts, cashew nuts and a number of spices and is the **2nd largest producer of fruits and vegetables**
    9. Organic agriculture offers a means to **substitute costlier agricultural inputs** (such as HYV seeds, chemical fertilizers, pesticides etc.) with locally produced organic inputs that are cheaper and thereby generate good returns on investment
        
        1. Since organic farming **requires more labor input than conventional farming**, India will find organic farming an attractive proposition. Finally, the produce is **pesticide-free and produced in an environmentally sustainable way**
        2. Yields from organic farming are **less than modern agricultural farming** in the initial years. Therefore, small and marginal farmers may find it difficult to adapt to largescale production.
    10. Greater need today to make **rural areas more vibrant through diversification into dairying, poultry, fisheries, vegetables and fruits** and linking up the rural production centers with the urban and foreign (export) markets to realize higher returns on the investments for the products. Moreover, infrastructure elements like credit and marketing, **farmer friendly agricultural policies** and a constant appraisal and dialogue between farmers’ groups and state agricultural departments are essential to realize the full potential of the sector￼
8. Employment
    
    1. Every working person is actively contributing to **national income and hence**, the development of the country by engaging in various economic activities — that is the real meaning of ‘earning’ a living. Mahatma Gandhi insisted upon education and training through a variety of works including craft
    2. **Women workers account for 1/3 of rural workforce** whereas in urban areas, **they are just 1/5 of workforce.** Worker-population ratio is an indicator which is used for analyzing the employment situation in the country. **It is higher in rural areas** (why?)
    3. About 52% workforce in India belongs to self-employed category. Casual wage laborers account for 30% of India’s workforce. **Regular salaried employed people are 18%. Agriculture - 49%, Manufacturing - 24%, Services - 27%**
    4. In the late 1990s: employment growth started declining and reached the level of growth that India had in the early stages of planning. During these years, we also find a widening **gap between the growth of GDP and employment.** This means that in the Indian economy, without generating employment, we have been able to produce more goods and services - phenomenon as **jobless growth****.** Process of moving from self-employment and regular salaried employment to casual wage work as casualization of workforce.
    5. **All the public sector** establishments and those **private sector establishments which employ 10 hired workers** or more are called formal sector establishments
    6. 3 sources of data on unemployment : **Census of India, National Sample Survey Organization and Directorate General of Employment and Training Data**. A comparison of unemployment rates in India and OECD countries shows that it has always been much **lower in India, around 3.5% (now at 7% Feb-18) against OECD’s 6.1%**
        
        1. National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005. It promises 100 days of guaranteed wage employment to all rural households who **volunteer to do unskilled manual work.**￼
9. Infrastructure
    
    1. Infrastructure is the **support system on which depends the efficient working** of a modern industrial economy, contributes to economic and social development of a country both by **increasing the productivity** of the factors of production and improving the quality of life of its people.
        
        1. E.g. Improvements in water supply and sanitation have a large impact by **reducing morbidity** (meaning proneness to fall ill) from **major waterborne diseases** and reducing the **severity of disease** when it occurs
    2. Development of infrastructure and economic development go hand in hand. Agriculture depends, to a considerable extent, on the **adequate expansion and development of irrigation facilities**. Industrial progress depends on the development of power and electricity generation, transport and communications
    3. Energy is a critical aspect of the development process of a nation.
        
        1. Commercial and non-commercial sources of energy. Commercial sources are coal, petroleum and electricity as they are bought and sold. Non-commercial sources of energy are firewood, agricultural waste and dried dung, accounting for over 26% of the total energy consumption
    4. Some of the challenges that India’s power sector faces today are (i) India’s installed **capacity to generate electricity is not sufficient** to feed an annual economic growth of 7-8 per cent. (ii) State Electricity Boards (SEBs), which distribute electricity, incur losses which **exceed Rs 500 billion** (iii) private sector power generators are yet to play their role in a major way (iv) there i**s general public unrest** due to high power tariffs (v) thermal power plants which are the **mainstay of India’s power sector** are facing **shortage** of raw material and coal supplies.
    5. Health is not only absence of disease but also the **ability to realize one’s potential.** Scholars assess people’s health by taking into account indicators like **infant mortality and maternal mortality rates, life expectancy and nutrition levels**, along with the incidence of communicable and non-communicable diseases
        
        1. Since independence, there has been a **significant expansion in the physical provision** of health services. During 1951-2013, the number of government hospitals and dispensaries increased from **9,300 to 44,000** and hospital beds from **1.2 to 6.3 lakh.**
        2. Expansion of health infrastructure has resulted in the **eradication of smallpox, guinea worms and the near eradication of polio and leprosy**
        3. More than **70% of the hospitals in India are run by the private sector**. They control **nearly 40% of beds available** in the hospitals.
        4. Private sector in India has grown independently without any major regulation; some private practitioners are not even registered doctors and are known as quacks
    6. Indian Systems of Medicine (ISM) includes six systems — **Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Naturopathy and Homeopathy (AYUSH).**
        
        1. At present there are **3167 ISM hospitals**, 26,000 dispensaries and as many as 7 lakh registered practitioners in India.
        2. ISM ha**s huge potential and can solve a large part** of our health care problems because they are effective, safe and inexpensive
    7. India has about **17% of the world’s population** but it bears **20% of the global burden** of diseases (GBD). GBD is an indicator used by experts to gauge the number of people **dying prematurely** due to a particular disease as well as the number of years spent by them in a state of ‘disability’ owing to the disease.
        
        1. More than half of GBD is **accounted for by communicable diseases** such as diarrhea, malaria and tuberculosis.
    8. Women suffer **many disadvantages** as compared to men in the areas of education, participation in economic activities and health care.
        
        1. More than 50% of married women between the age group of 15 and 49% have **anemia and nutritional anemia** caused by iron deficiency, which has contributed to **19% of maternal deaths.** Abortions are also a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in India.￼
10. Environment & Sustainable Development
    
    1. Economic development that we have achieved so far has come at a very heavy price —at the **cost of environmental quality**. Environment is defined as the **total planetary inheritance and the totality of all resources**
    2. Neglect rest, overlap with Shankar ￼
      
    

Class 12 - Macro
 13. Introduction
    
    1. Capitalist economy can be defined as an **economy in which most of the economic activities** have the following characteristics (a) there is **private ownership** of means of production (b) production takes place for **selling the output** in the market (c) there is sale and purchase of labor services at a price which is called the **wage rate**
    2. Apart from the **firms and the government,** there is another major sector in an economy which is called the **household sector.** By a household we mean a **single individual** **who takes decisions** relating to her own consumption, or a group of individuals for whom decisions relating to consumption are jointly determined.
    3. Macroeconomics sees an economy as a combination of four sectors, namely **households, firms, government and external sector.**￼
14. National Income
    
    1. The economic wealth, or well-being, of a country thus does not **necessarily depend on the mere possession of resources**; the point is how these resources are used in generating a flow of production and how, as a consequence, income and wealth are generated from that process
    2. Final goods - once it has been sold it **passes out of the active economic flow.** Of the final goods, **goods like food and clothing, and services** like recreation that are consumed when purchased by their ultimate consumers are called **consumption goods** or consumer goods. **Capital goods that are of durable character** which are used in the production process.
    3. Intermediate goods - don’t end up in final consumption and are not capital goods either. Not final goods**. Counting these separately will lead to the error of double counting**
    4. Stock and flows - Flows are defined **over a period of time**. Stocks are defined at a **particular point of time**. Part of our final output that comprises of **capital goods constitutes gross investment of an economy.** Deletion made from the value of gross investment in order to **accommodate regular wear and tear of capital,** is called depreciation.
    5. At a particular period, given a level of total output of the economy, **it is true if more capital goods are produced less of consumer goods would be produced.** But production of more capital goods would mean that in future the laborers would have more capital equipment to work with
    6. Value added method - calculate the **aggregate annual value of goods and services produced.** Net contribution made by a firm is called its **value added.** Value added is a **flow** variable. Raw materials which a firm carries from one year to the next is called **inventory**. Inventory is a **stock variable,** while change in inventories is a flow variable. **Inventories are treated as capita**l. Addition to the stock of capital of a firm is known as investment. Therefore change in the inventory of a firm is treated as investment.
        
        1. GDP ≡ **Sum total of gross value added** of all the firms in the economy.
    7. Expenditure method - alternative way to calculate the GDP is by looking at the demand side of the products. Expenditure on **intermediate goods is not included in the calculation of GDP**, **expenditure on investments is included**. Consumption can be Consumer, Government, Investment or Net Exports.
    8. Income Method - sum of final expenditures in the economy must be equal to the incomes received by all the factors of production taken together. Gives NDP fc
    ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020250424103504-1.tiff)10. Net factor income from abroad = **Factor income earned by the domestic factors of production employed** in the rest of the world – **Factor income earned by the factors of production** of the rest of the world employed in the domestic economy
    11. **Market price includes indirect taxes**. When indirect taxes are imposed on goods and services, their prices go up. Indirect taxes accrue to the government. We have to deduct them from **NNP evaluated at market prices** in order to calculate that part of NNP which actually accrues to the factors of production.
    12. Personal Income (PI) ≡ NI – Undistributed profits – Net interest payments made by households – Corporate tax + Transfer payments to the households from the government and firms (subsidies)
    13. Personal Disposable Income (PDI ) ≡ PI – Personal tax payments – Non-tax payments. This is **part of the aggregate income which belongs to the households.**
    14. Other aggregates
        
        1. National Disposable Income = **Net National Product at market prices + Other current transfers from the rest of the world**
        2. Private Income = Factor income from net domestic product accruing to the **private secto****r** + **National debt interest** + **Net factor income from abroad** + Current transfers from government + Other net transfers from the rest of the world
    15. Real GDP is calculated in a way such that the **goods and services are evaluated at some constant set of prices** (or constant prices). Since these prices remain fixed, if the Real GDP changes we can be sure that it is the **volume of production which is undergoing changes.** Nominal GDP, on the other hand, is **simply the value of GDP** at the current prevailing prices. The ratio of **nominal to real GDP is a well known index of prices. This is called GDP** **Deflator****.**
    16. Consumer Price Index (CPI) - is index of **prices of a given basket of commodities which are bought by the representative consumer**. CPI is generally expressed in percentage terms.
    17. CPI (and WPI) may differ from GDP deflator because
        
        1. Goods purchased by consumers do **not represent all the goods** which are produced in a country. **GDP deflator takes into account** **all** **such goods and services.**
        2. CPI includes prices of goods consumed by the representative consumer, hence it includes prices of **imported** goods. GDP deflator does **not** include prices of imported goods.
        3. Weights are constant in CPI – but they **differ according to production level of each good in GDP deflator.**
    18. Higher level of GDP of a country as an index of greater well-being of the people of that country? Problems with the approach are neglecting - inequalities, non-monetary exchanges and externalities. ￼
15. Money and Banking
    
    1. First and foremost role of money is that it **acts as a medium of exchange**. Barter exchanges become **extremely difficult in a large economy** because improbability of double coincidence of wants. Money also acts as a convenient unit of account. Money can act as a store of value for individuals
    2. Demand for money balance is often referred to as **liquidity preference.** Number of times a unit of **money changes hands** during the unit period is called the **velocity of circulation of money**
    3. Total value of annual transactions in an economy includes **transactions in all intermediate goods and services** and is clearly much greater than the nominal GDP. Transaction demand for money is **positively related** to the real income of an economy and also to its average price level.
    4. Speculations regarding **future movements in interest rate and bond prices give rise to the speculative demand for money**. Speculative demand for money is **inversely related to the rate of interest.**
    5. Liquidity trap is when there's a **lot of capital in the economy,** but it's not used for investment or spending. Instead, it's **hoarded or used for non-productive activities**. As a result, low interest rates and easy money don't translate into healthy economic growth, well-paying jobs and higher prices.
    6. Fiat money - value of the currency notes and coins is **derived from the guarantee provided by the issuing authority of these items.** Every currency note bears on its face a promise from the Governor of RBI that if someone produces the note to RBI, or any other commercial bank, RBI will be responsible for giving the person **purchasing power equal to the value** printed on the note.
        
        1. They do **not have intrinsic value** like a gold or silver coin. They are also **called legal tenders as they cannot be refused** by any citizen of the country for settlement of any kind of transaction. Cheques drawn on savings or current accounts, however, **can be refused** by anyone as a mode of payment. Hence, **demand deposits are not legal tenders.**
    7. Currency deposit ratio (cdr) is the **ratio of money held by the public in currency** to that **they hold in bank deposits**. Reserve deposit ratio (rdr) is the proportion of the total deposits commercial banks keep as reserves
    8. RBI uses various policy instruments to bring **forth a healthy rdr in commercial banks.**
        
        1. Cash Reserve Ratio which specifies the fraction of their deposits that **banks must keep** with RBI.
        2. Statutory Liquidity Ratio which **requires the banks to maintain a given fraction of their total demand** and time deposits in the form of specified liquid assets.
        3. Commercial banks can **borrow money from RBI at the bank rate** when they run **short of reserves.** A high bank rate makes such **borrowing from RBI costly** and, in effect, encourages the commercial banks to maintain a healthy rdr.
    9. High Powered Money: **total liability of RBI is called the monetary base or high powered money.** It consists of **currency (in circulation with public and vault cash of banks)** and deposits held by Government and commercial banks with RBI
    10. Money multiplier is the **ratio of the stock of money supply** to the stock of **high powered money in an economy (m3/m0)**. It's **always greater than 1**. Commercial banks create this extra amount of money by giving out a part of their deposits as loans or investment credits.
    11. Financing of budget deficits by the government**s by selling T-bills to RBI** (basically printing money) is called **Deficit Financing through Central Bank Borrowing.**
    12. RBI will undertake an **open market sale of government securities** of an amount equal to the **amount of foreign exchange inflow** in the economy, thereby keeping the **stock of high powered money** and **total money supply** **unchanged****.** Thus it sterilizes the economy **against adverse external shocks.** This operation of RBI is known as sterilization￼
16. Income Determination
    
    1. Planned values of the variables – **consumption, investment or output of final goods** – are **ex ante** measures. Actual or accounting values are **ex post measures** of these items.
    2. Paradox of Thrift - if people **save more in a recession, it will reduce consumption and thus aggregate demand will fall**, impeding economic growth and, in fact, lowering the general level of savings.
17. Govt
    
    1. **Public goods** such as national defense, roads, government administration, as distinct from private goods (like clothes, cars, food items), **cannot be provided through the market mechanism.** This is the allocation function. Government affects the **personal disposable income of households by making transfer payments and collecting taxes** and, therefore, can alter the income distribution. This is the distribution function
    2. Tax revenue - Tax revenues, an **important component of revenue receipts, comprise of direct taxes** – personal income tax and corporation tax, and indirect taxes like excise taxes, customs duties and service tax
    3. Non-tax revenue - **consists of interest receipts** on account of loans by the central government, dividends and profits on investments, **fees and other receipts for services rendered by the government.** Cash grants-in-aid from foreign countries and international organizations are also included.
    4. **Revenue Expenditure** is expenditure incurred for purposes other than the creation of physical or financial assets of the central government.
        
        1. Main items of non-plan expenditure are **interest payments, defense services, subsidies, salaries and pensions**
    5. Capital receipts - which **create liability or reduce financial assets** are termed as capital receipts.
        
        1. Main items of **capital receipts are loans raised by the government** from the public which are called market borrowings, borrowing by the government **through sale of treasury bills,** loans received from foreign governments and international organizations, and recoveries of loans.
        2. Other items **include small savings** (Post-Office Savings Accounts, National Savings Certificates, etc), provident funds and PSU disinvestment)
    6. Capital expenditure - expenditures of the government which result in creation of physical or financial assets or reduction in financial liabilities.
        
        1. Nonplan capital expenditure covers **various general, social and economic services provided by the government**
    7. **3 policy statements are mandated** by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 (FRBMA)
        
        1. **Medium-term Fiscal Policy** - sets a **3-year rolling target** for specific fiscal indicators and examines whether **revenue expenditure can be financed through revenue receipts** on a sustainable basis and how productively capital receipts including market borrowings are being utilized.
            
            1. presented separately in the session next to the session in which Union Budget is presented, i.e. **normally in the Monsoon Session**. First time in 2013
        2. Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement - sets the **priorities of the government** in the fiscal area, examining current policies and **justifying any deviation** in important fiscal measures
        3. Macroeconomic Framework Statement - assesses the **prospects of the economy with respect to the GDP growth rate**, fiscal balance of the central government and external balance
    8. Budgetary deficits must be **financed by either taxation, borrowing or printing money.** Governments have **mostly relied on borrowing,** giving rise to what is called government debt.
    9. **Ricardian equivalence** is an economic theory that suggests **when** a government tries to stimulate an **economy by increasing debt-financed government spending**, demand remains **unchanged**.
    10. One of the main criticisms of deficits is that they are **inflationary**. This is because when government increases spending or cuts taxes, **aggregate demand increases**. Firms may **not be able to produce** higher quantities that are being demanded at the ongoing prices. Prices will, therefore, **have to rise.** A high fiscal deficit is accompanied by higher demand and **greater output** and, therefore, need not be inflationary
    11. **Same fiscal measures can give rise to a large or small deficit, depending on the state of the economy.** For example, if an economy experiences a recession and GDP falls, tax revenues fall because firms and households pay lower taxes when they earn less. This means that the deficit increases in a recession and falls in a boom, even with no change in fiscal policy.￼
18. Open Economy
    
    1. Foreign trade **influences Indian aggregate demand** in two ways.
        
        1. when Indians buy **foreign** goods, this **spending escapes as a leakage** from the circular flow of income decreasing aggregate demand.
        2. **Exports** to foreigners enter as an **injection into the circular flow,** increasing aggregate demand for domestically produced goods.
        3. Total **foreign trade** (exports + imports) as a **proportion** of GDP is a common measure of the **degree of openness** of an economy
    2. Balance of payments (BoP) record the transactions in goods, services and assets between **residents of a country with the rest of the world** for a specified time period typically a year
        
        1. Current account records **exports and imports** in goods and services and transfer payments
        2. Trade in services **denoted as invisible trade** includes **both factor income** (net income from compensation of employees and net investment income, the latter equals, the interest, profits and dividends on our assets abroad minus the income foreigners earn on assets they own in India) and **net non-factor income** (shipping, banking, insurance, tourism, software services, etc.).
        3. **Transfer payments are receipts** which the residents of a country receive ‘for free’, without having to make any present or future payments in return. They **consist of remittances, gifts and grants.**
        4. Capital account records all international purchases and sales of assets such as money, stocks, bonds, etc
    3. Autonomous and Accommodating Transactions:
        
        1. International economic transactions are called **autonomous when transactions are made independently of the state of the BoP (**for instance due to profit motive). These items are called **‘above the line’ items in the BoP**. The balance of payments is said to be in **surplus** (deficit) if autonomous receipts are greater (less) than autonomous payments.
        2. Accommodating transactions (termed **‘below the line’** items), on the other hand, are determined by the **net consequences of the autonomous items, that is, whether the BoP is in surplus or deficit**. The official reserve transactions are seen as the **accommodating item in the BoP** (all others being autonomous).
    4. Exchange rates in the market depend not only on the demand and supply of exports and imports, and investment in assets, but **also on foreign exchange speculation** where foreign exchange is demanded for the possible gains from appreciation of the currency. **Money in any country is an asset**
    5. A rise in the interest rates at home often leads to an **appreciation of the domestic currency**. implicit assumption is that **no restrictions exist in buying bonds** issued by foreign governments.
    6. According to the PPP theory, **differences** in the domestic inflation and foreign inflation are a **major cause of adjustment** in exchange rates. If one country has **higher inflation than another, its exchange rate should be depreciating** (not valid if protectionist measures applied).
    7. Open economy multiplier is **smaller than that in a closed economy** because a part of **domestic demand falls on foreign goods**. An increase in autonomous demand thus leads to a **smaller increase in output in open economy** vs a closed economy. It also results in a deterioration of the trade balance
