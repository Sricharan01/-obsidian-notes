1. **Prehistoric Rock Paintings**
    
    1. Distant past when there was no paper, language or written word is **prehistory**. Excavations of prehistoric sites brought to light **old tools, pottery, habitats, bones of ancient human beings and animals and cave drawings**. When the basic needs of food, water, clothing and shelter were fulfilled people felt the need to express themselves. **Painting and drawing were the oldest art forms** practiced by human beings to express themselves, using the cave walls as their canvas.
        
        1. Why did prehistoric people draw these pictures? They may have drawn and painted to make their homes **more colorful and beautiful** or to keep a visual record of their day-to-day life, like some of us who maintain a diary
        2. Prehistoric paintings have been found in many parts of the world. Don't know if Lower Paleolithic art exists, but **Upper period has walls of many caves** of this time are full of finely carved and painted pictures of animals which the cave-dwellers hunted. Subjects of their drawings were **human figures, human activities, geometric designs and symbols**. In India the earliest paintings have been reported from the **Upper Paleolithic times.**
    2. 1st discovery of rock paintings was made in India in 1867–68 by an archaeologist, **Archibald Carlleyle**, 12 years before the discovery of Altamira in Spain.
        
        1. Remnants of rock paintings have been found on the walls of the caves situated in several districts of MP, UP, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Bihar.
    3. **Lakhudiyar caves** in Almora- Paintings here can be divided into three categories: **man, animal and geometric patterns** in white, black and red ochre.
        
        1. Humans are represented in **stick-like forms**. Long-snouted animal, a **fox and a multiple legged lizard** are the main animal motifs. Wavy lines, rectangle-filled geometric designs, and groups of dots can also be seen here (**trishul and swastika**)
        2. **Hand linked** dancing human figures
    4. **South India** - famous sites Kupgallu (TG), Piklihal and Tekkalkota (KTK). Three types of paintings have been reported from here—paintings in **white, red over white and red ochre.** Cover all **PMN periods.**
        
        1. Subjects depicted are bulls, elephants, sambhars, gazelles, sheep, goats, **horses**, **stylized humans**, tridents, but **rarely, plant motifs**
    5. **Richest paintings - from the Vindhya ranges** of Madhya Pradesh and their Kaimurean extensions into UP. Full of **Paleolithic and Mesolithic** remains, and they are also full of forests, wild plants, fruits, streams and creeks, thus a **perfect place for Stone Age** people to live.
        
        1. **Bhimbetka**, in an area of 10 sq km, has about **800 rock shelters, 500 of which bear paintings**. Discovered in 1957–58 by **V.S. Wakankar**
        2. Paintings found here are of great variety - ranging from **mundane events of daily life in those times to sacred and royal images**. These include hunting, dancing, music, **horse and elephant riders**, animal fighting, honey collection, decoration of bodies, and other household scenes.
        3. Rock art of Bhimbetka has been classified into various groups on the bases of style, technique and superimposition.
            
            1. **Upper Paleolithic** - green and dark red, of **animal figures**, such as bison, elephants, tigers, rhinos and boars. And **stick-like human figures.**
            2. **Mesolithic** - **Largest number of paintings**. Hunting scenes depict people hunting in groups, armed with barbed spears, pointed sticks, arrows and bows. Men adorned with elaborate head-dresses, and with masks also. **Loved to paint animals (birds too).** Paintings show **fear of animals as well as love** for them. Many rock-shelters have hand prints, fist prints, and dots made by the fingertips.
            3. Chalcolithic/Copper - reveal **contact with settled communities of Malwa** plateau. Ceramics and rock paintings have common motifs - cross hatched squares and lattices. Pottery and metal tools too.
        4. Artists of Bhimbetka **used many colors**, including but **white and red were favorite.** Paints were made by **grinding various rocks and minerals.**
            
            1. Got red from **haematite** (geru), green from stone called **chalcedony**, white maybe from **limestone**. First ground into powder then mixed with water and **sticky substance** (fat, gum, resin).
            2. Brushes made of **plant fiber**. Colors have survived thousands of years in adverse weather conditions. **Colors have remained intact because of the chemical reaction of the oxide present** on the surface of the rocks. #important
        5. Men seem adventurous and rejoicing in their lives, animals more youthful and majestic than they were. Artists seem to have **passion for storytelling**. Paintings are usually **super-imposed.**￼

An armlet is worn on the right hand and holes around the neck suggest a necklace.
    3. **Bronze casting** - art was practiced on a **wide scale by the Harappans**. Made using the ‘lost wax’ technique in which the **wax figures were first covered with a coating of clay and allowed to dry**. Then wax was heated and the molten wax was drained out through a tiny hole made in the clay cover. Hollow mould thus created was filled with molten metal which took the original shape of the object. Once the metal cooled, the clay cover was completely removed. #important

        3. Paintings at the Kanchipuram temple were patronized by the Pallava king, Rajasimha. Only traces of paintings remain now which depict Somaskanda.
        4. When the Pandyas rose to power, they too patronized art. **Tirumalaipuram** caves and **Jaina caves at Sittanavasal** are some of the surviving examples.
        5. Though Chola paintings are seen in **Nartamalai**, the most important are those in **Brihadeswara** temple. Mainly Shiva paintings.
    3. **Vijayanagara** - With the decline of power of the Chola dynasty in 13th century Vijayanagara Dynasty captured and brought under its control the region from Hampi to Trichy with Hampi serving as its capital.
        
        1. Many paintings survive in a number of temples. Paintings at **Tiruparakunram**, near Trichy, done in 14th century represent the early phase of the Vijayanagara style.
        2. In Hampi, the **V****irupaksha temple** has paintings on the ceiling of its **mandapa** narrating events from dynastic history and episodes from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.
        3. In **Lepakshi**, near Hindupur in AP, there are glorious examples of **Vijayanagara** paintings on the **walls of the Shiva temple.** Lepakshi is location of shrines dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and **Veerabhadra**
        4. **Nayaka** rulers (successors of Vijayanagara) paintings depict episodes from the Mahabharata and the Ramayana and also scenes from Krishna-leela. Sites - Tiruparakunram, Sreerangam, Tiruvarur.
    4. Kerala - painters (during 16th-18th century) evolved a pictorial language and technique of their own while discriminately adopting **certain stylistic** elements from **Nayaka and Vijayanagara** schools.
        
        1. Painters evolved a language taking cues from contemporary traditions like **Kathakali and kalamezhuthu** (basically rangoli - with 5 colors) using vibrant and luminous colors
        2. oral traditions and local versions of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata for painted narration.

        1. cave-like sanctum (**garbhagriha** literally ‘womb-house’), which, in the early temples, was a small **cubicle** **with a single entrance** and grew into a larger chamber in time. Garbhagriha is made to house the **main icon** which is itself the focus of much ritual attention
        2. Entrance to the temple which may be a portico or colonnaded hall that incorporates space for a large number of worshippers and is known as a **mandapa**
        3. **From 5th century CE onwards**, freestanding temples tend to have a **mountain- like spire**, which can take the shape of a curving **shikhar** in North India and a pyramidal tower, called a **vimana**, in South India

        4. Garbhagriha is always located **directly under the tallest tower.**
        5. Many **subdivisions of nagara temples** depending on the shape of the shikhara.
        
        1. Second major type of architectural form in the nagara order is the **phamsana**.
            
            1. **Phamsana** buildings tend to be **broader and shorter than latina ones.**
            2. Roofs are composed of **several slabs** that **gently rise to a single point** over the center of the building, unlike the latina ones which look like **sharply rising** tall towers.
            3. Phamsana roofs **do not curve inward**, instead they slope upwards on a **straight incline.** #important
            4. In many North Indian temples you will notice that the **phamsana design is used for the mandapas while the main garbhagriha is housed in a latina building.**
        2. 3rd main sub-type of the nagara building is what is generally called the **valabhi** type. These are **rectangular** **buildings with a roof** that rises into a **vaulted chamber**
            
            1. Edge of this vaulted chamber is **rounded**, like the bamboo or wooden wagons
    4. Central India -
        
        1. Ancient temples of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh (most Gupta-era are here) and Rajasthan share many traits. The most visible is that they are **made of** **sandstone**.
        2. Late Gupta period temples - **Udaigiri and Sanchi** (MP). ￼**Deograh (UP) has a dashavatar temple** - 6th century CE - one of earliest Hindu stone temple

            5. First recorded mention of the Khajuraho temples is in the accounts of Abu Rihan **al Biruni** in AD 1022 and the Arab traveler **Ibn Battuta** in AD 1335.
            6. **Kandariya Mahadeo** largest and most ornate temple here (**dedicated to Shiva**). Khajuraho group of temples were **built together** but were dedicated to two religions, **Hinduism and Jainism**, suggesting a tradition of acceptance and respect for diverse religious views. Also some temples dedicated to **Tantric** cult. Tantra introduced **icons, puja and temple building** into Hinduism #important
    5. West India
        
        1. Stone used to build the **temples** ranges **in color and type.**
            
            1. While **sandstone** is the commonest, a **grey to black** **basalt** can be seen in some of the 10th to 12th century temple sculptures.
            2. most exuberant and famed is the **manipulatable** **soft white marble** which is also seen in some of the 10th-12th century **Jain temples** in Mount Abu and 15th century temple at **Ranakpur**.
            3. Most important art-historical sites in the region is **Shamlaji** (**Vishnu**/Krishna, 11th century) in Gujarat which shows how earlier artistic traditions of the region **mixed with a post-Gupta style** and gave rise to a distinct style of sculpture
        2. **Sun temple at Modhera,** Gujarat - dates back to early 11th century and was built by Raja Bhimdev I of the **Solanki Dynasty** in 1026. Solankis were a branch of the later Chalukyas.
            
            1. There is a massive rectangular stepped tank called the **surya kund** in front of it **(grandest temple tank in India)** #important
            2. Huge ornamental **arch-torana** leads one to the sabha mandapa (the assembly hall) which is open on all sides
            3. Influence of the **woodcarving** **tradition of Gujarat is evident** in the lavish carving and sculpture work.
    6. East India - NE, Bengal and Odisha. Appears that **terracotta** **was the main medium of construction**, and also for moulding plaques which depicted Buddhist and Hindu deities in Bengal **until the 7th century.**
        
        1. Assam - An old 6th century sculpted door frame from Doparvatia near Tezpur and few sculptures from Rangagora Tea Estate near Tinsukia in Assam bear witness to the **import of the Gupta idiom** in that region.
            
            1. **Distinct Assam style developed by 12th-14th century** with the migration of **Tais from Upper Burma mixed with dominant Pala style** of Bengal, led to the creation of **Ahom style**. **Kamakhya** **temple** is an example
        2. Bengal - style of sculptures in Bengal and Bihar is **known as Pala** (9th-11th century AD) and **Sena** (mid-11th to mid-13th century). While **Palas celebrated as patrons of** **Buddhist** **monastic sites**, temples from that region are known to express local **Vanga** style. #important
            
            1. 9th century **Siddheshvara Mahadeva** temple in Barakar in Burdwan, shows a tall curving **shikhara crowned by a large amalaka** and is an example of early Pala style.
            2. Many local vernacular building traditions of Bengal also influenced the style of temples in that region. Most prominent of these was the shape of the **curving or sloping side of the bamboo roof of a Bengali hut.** This feature was eventually even adopted in Mughal buildings, and is known across North India as **Bangla roof.**
        3. Odisha - main architectural features of Odisha temples are classified in three orders, i.e., **rekhapida, pidhadeul and khakra**.
            
            1. Temples of Odisha constitute a distinct sub-style within the **nagara** order.
            2. In general, here the **shikhara, called deul in Odisha**, is vertical **almost until the top** when it suddenly curves sharply inwards. Deuls are preceded, as usual, by **mandapas** called **jagamohana** in Odisha.
            3. Ground plan of the main temple is almost always **square**, which, in the upper reaches of its superstructure becomes circular in the **crowning mastaka.** Odisha temples **usually have boundary walls.**
            4. At Konark, on the shores of the Bay of Bengal, lie the majestic ruins of the **Surya or Sun temple** built in stone around 1240 by Narashimhadeva I of **Eastern Ganga dynasty.** World Heritage Site in 1984.
            5. Its shikhara was a colossal creation said to have reached 70m, which, proving too heavy for its site, **fell in the 19th century**. The complex has largest enclosed space in Hindu architecture. Also called **Black Pagoda. Chandrabhaga mela** happens here. **Jagannath Temple** in Puri was called the **“White Pagoda”.**
            6. Sun temple is set on a high base, its walls covered in extensive, detailed **ornamental carving.** These include **twelve pairs of enormous wheels** sculpted with spokes and hubs, representing the chariot wheels of the Sun god. Whole temple thus comes to **resemble a colossal processional chariot.**
        4. The Hills -
            
            1. Unique form of architecture developed in the hills of **Kumaon, Garhwal,** Himachal and Kashmir. Kashmir’s proximity to **prominent Gandhara sites** (such as Taxila, Peshawar and the northwest frontier) lent the region a **strong Gandhara influence** by the 5th century CE. This began to mix with the Gupta and post-Gupta traditions that were brought to it from **Sarnath, Mathura** and even centers in Gujarat and Bengal.
            2. **Karkota period of Kashmir** is the most significant in terms of architecture. One of the most important temples is **Pandrethan** (possibly Shiva), built during 8th-9th centuries.
            3. Sculptures at Chamba also show an amalgamation of local traditions with a post- Gupta style. The images of **Mahishasuramardini and Narasimha** at the **Lakshana-Devi Mandir** (HP) are evidences of the influence of the **post-Gupta** tradition
    7. Dravidian temples
        
        1. ![Dravidian Temp es Gopuram, E ntrance Spire Pillared Halls Water tank OFFICC Mantapam ](Exported%20image%2020250424103658-4.tiff)
            1. Dravida temple is **enclosed within a compound wall.** The front wall has an entrance gateway in its center, which is known as a **gopuram**. The shape of the **main temple tower known as vimana** in Tamil Nadu is like a **stepped pyramid** that rises up **geometrically rather than the curving shikhara** of North India. In the South Indian temple, the word ‘shikhara’ is used only for the **crowning** element at the top of the temple
            2. At **entrance** of grabhariha, sculptures of **fierce dvarapalas** or the door-keepers guarding the temple.
            3. **Large water tank within complex common.**
            4. North Indian idea of **multiple shikharas rising together as a cluster was not popular** in South India.
        2. Temples started becoming the focus of urban architecture. **Kanchipuram, Tanjore, Madurai and Kumbakonam** are the most famous temple towns of Tamil Nadu, where, during 8-12th AD centuries, the role of the temple was not limited to religious matters alone. **Temples became rich administrative centers,** controlling vast areas of land.
        3. Subdivisions of dravida temples, basically of five different shapes:
            
            1. square, usually called **kuta**, and also caturasra;
            2. rectangular or **shala** or ayatasra;
            3. elliptical, called **gaja-prishta** or elephant- backed, or also called vrittayata, deriving from wagon-vaulted shapes of apsidal chaityas with a horse-shoe shaped entrance facade usually called a nasi
            4. circular or **vritta**; and
            5. octagonal or **ashtasra**.
        4. **Pallavas** introduced the art of **excavating temples** **from the rock,** and the Dravidian style of temple architecture began with their rule. **Were mostly Shaivite**, but several **Vaishnava** shrines also survived from their reign, and were influenced by the long **Buddhist** history of the Deccan. Their early buildings, it is generally assumed, were **rock-cut,** while the later ones were structural.
            
            1. Early buildings are generally attributed to the reign of **Mahendravarman I**, a contemporary of the Chalukyan king Pulakesin II.
            2. **Narasimhavarman I, also known as Mamalla,** who acceded the Pallava throne around 640 CE, is celebrated for the expansion of the empire, avenging the defeat his father had suffered at the hands of Pulakesin II, and inaugurating most of the building works at **Mahabalipuram** which is known after him as **Mamallapuram**.
            3. **Shore temple at Mahabalipuram** was built later, probably in the reign of **Narasimhavarman II, also known as Rajasimha** who reigned from 700 to 728 CE. Houses three shrines, **two to Shiva**, one facing east and the other west, and a middle one to Vishnu who is shown as **Anantashayana**.
            4. **Group of Monuments at Mamallapuram** - one of the largest open-air rock reliefs in the world: the **Descent of the Ganges or Arjuna's Penance**
        5. Cholas - Shiva temple of Thanjavur, called the **Rajarajeswara** or **Brihadiswara** temple, was completed around 1009 by **Rajaraja Chola, and is the** **largest** **and tallest of all Indian temples.**
            
            1. Chola period are in a **good state of preservation**, and many more are still active shrines. Bigger in scale than anything built by their predecessors, the Pallavas, Chalukyas or Pandyas, this Chola temple’s **pyramidal multi-storeyed** vimana rises a **massive 70 meters**
            2. One of the largest and tallest of Indian temples, **fully realized Tamil architecture**
            3. Topped by a **monolithic shikhara** which is an octagonal dome-shaped stupika.
            4. The main deity of the temple is **Shiva**, who is shown as a huge lingam set in a two storied sanctum. Location that commissioned the brass Nataraja – Shiva as the lord of dance, in 11th century
            5. **Great Living Chola Temples** consist of BAG - Brihadisvara, Airavatesvara, Gangaikonda Cholapuram.
    8. **Deccan architecture** - hybridized **nagara-dravida** style known as **vesara** from mid-7th century onwards.
        
        1. By about 750 CE, the early western Chalukya control of the Deccan was taken by the **Rashtrakutas**. Krishna I's greatest achievement in architecture is the **Kailashnath temple at Ellora**
        2. Culmination of at least a millennium-long tradition in rock-cut architecture in India. It is a complete **Dravida building with a Nandi shrine**—since the temple is dedicated to Shiva—a **gopuram-like gateway,** surrounding cloisters, subsidiary shrines, staircases and an imposing vimana rising to 30 metres.
        3. Importantly, **all of this is carved out of living rock**. One portion of the monolithic hill was carved patiently to build the Kailashnath temple
        4. Sculpture of the **Rashtrakuta phase at Ellora is dynamic,** the figures often larger than life-size, infused with **unparalleled grandeur** and the most overwhelming energy
    9. Karnataka has more experimental **hybrid styles of vesara** architecture. **Early Chalukyan** activity also takes the **form of rock-cut caves** while later activity is of structural temples.
        
        1. The **earliest** is probably the **Ravana Phadi rock cave at Aihole (Shiva)** which is known for its distinctive sculptural style.
        2. One of the most important sculptures at the site is of **Nataraja**, surrounded by larger-than-life-size depictions of saptamatrikas
        3. **Hybridization and incorporation** of several styles was the hallmark of Chalukyan buildings. Most elaborate of all Chalukyan temples at **Pattadakal** (9 Hindu 1 Jain temple, UN Heritage site) made in the reign of **Vikramaditya II** (733-44) by his chief queen Loka Mahadevi shows complete knowledge of Pallava buildings at Kanchipuram and as a corollary, Mahabalipuram.
        4. **Durga temple** **at Aihole** is unique having an even earlier style of an apsidal shrine which is **reminiscent of Buddhist chaitya** halls
        5. **Ladh Khan temple** **at Aihole** seems to be inspired by the **wooden-roofed temples** of the hills, except that it is constructed out of stone.
        6. With the waning of Chola and Pandya power, the Hoysalas of Karnataka grew to prominence in South India and became the **most important patrons** centered at Mysore.
            
            1. Temples at **Belur, Halebid and Somnathpuram** are most important
            2. **Hoysaleshvara** temple (Lord of the Hoysalas, **Shiva**) at **Halebid** in Karnataka was built in dark schist stone by the Hoysala king in 1150. **Chennakeshava temple** (**Vishnu**) in Belur — a **masterpiece** of **Hoysala** architecture
            3. Hoysala temples are sometimes called **hybrid or vesara** as their unique style seems **neither completely dravida nor nagara**, but somewhere in between. Easily distinguishable from other medieval temples by their **highly original star-like ground-plans** and a profusion of decorative carvings (because it's made of soapstone).
    10. Buddhist architecture
        
        1. When the Gupta empire crumbled in the 6th century CE Magadha appears to have remained unified whilst **numerous small Rajput principalities** sprang up to the west. In 8th century, the **Palas** came to power in the region. 2nd Pala ruler, **Dharmapala**, became immensely powerful and established an empire by **defeating the powerful Rajput Pratiharas. D**harmapala consolidated an empire whose wealth lay in a combination of agriculture along the fertile Ganges plain and international trade.
        2. Pre-eminent Buddhist site is **Bodhgaya**. Bodhgaya is a pilgrimage site since Siddhartha achieved enlightenment here and became Gautama Buddha. While the bodhi tree is of immense importance, **Mahabodhi Temple** at Bodhgaya is an important reminder of **brickwork** of that time.
        3. First shrine here, located at the base of the **Bodhi tree**, is said to have been constructed by **King Ashoka**; the **vedika around it is said to be post-Mauryan**, of about 100 BCE; many of the sculptures in the niches in the temple are dated to the **8th century Pala period**
            
            1. Design of the temple is unusual. It is, strictly speaking, neither dravida or nagara. It is narrow like a nagara temple, but it rises without curving, like a dravida one.
        4. Monastic university of Nalanda is a **mahavihara** as it is a complex of several monasteries of various sizes. Till date, only a small portion of this ancient learning center has been excavated as **most of it lies buried under contemporary civilization**, making further excavations almost impossible.
            
            1. Most of the information about **Nalanda is based on the records of** **Xuan Zang**—previously spelt as ‘Hiuen-tsang’— which states that the foundation of a monastery was laid by **Kumaragupta I in the 5th century CE**
            2. Evidence that all 3 Buddhist doctrines— **Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana.** Buddhist monasteries like Nalanda were prolific centers of art production that had a decisive impact on the arts of all Buddhist countries in Asia.
            3. Sculptural art of **Nalanda**, in stucco, stone and bronze, developed out of a **heavy dependence on Buddhist Gupta art of Sarnath.**
            4. Nalanda sculptures initially depict Buddhist deities of the **Mahayana** pantheon such as standing Buddhas, **bodhisattvas** such as Manjusri Kumara, Avalokiteshvara seated on a lotus and Naga-Nagarjuna. Later, when Nalanda emerged as an important tantric centre, the repertoire came to be **dominated by Vajrayana deities such as Vajrasharada (a form of Saraswati) Khasarpana, Avalokiteshvara** etc.
            5. **Avalokiteshvara (embodies compassion of all Buddhas)** is beloved throughout the Buddhist world—not only in **Mahayana Buddhism but also in Theravada** (“Way of the Elders”), the branch of Buddhism that largely does not recognize bodhisattvas
            6. Some Buddhist monasteries sites in Odisha - Sirpur Lalitagiri, Vajragiri and Ratnagiri
            7. **Nagapattinam** was also a major Buddhist center **right until the Chola Period**. One of the reasons for this must have been its importance in trade with Sri Lanka
    11. Jains were **prolific temple builders** like the Hindus, and their sacred shrines and pilgrimage spots are to be found across the length and breadth of India except in the hills. Oldest site is in Bihar.
        
        1. In the Deccan, some of the **most architecturally important Jain sites** can be found in **Ellora and Aihole**. In central India, **Deogarh, Khajuraho, Chanderi and Gwalior** have some excellent examples of Jain temples.
        2. Karnataka has a rich heritage of Jain shrines and at Sravana Belagola the famous statue of **Gomateshwara, the granite statue of Lord Bahubali** which stands 18 meters is the world’s tallest monolithic free-standing structure. Commissioned by **Chavundaraya**, Prime Minister of the **Ganga Kings** of Mysore.
        3. **Jain temples at Mount Abu** were constructed by Vimal Shah. Notable for a simplistic exterior in contrast with the exuberant marble interiors and unique patterns on every ceiling, and the graceful bracket figures along the domed ceilings.
    12. Important monuments
        
        1. **Mahabalipuram** - important coastal town from period of **Pallavas**. Dotted with several important rock-cut and free-standing structural temples mostly made in 7th-8th centuries
            
            1. Large sculptural panel, one of the **largest and oldest** known in the world
            2. Some believe that it is story on panel is of the descent of the Ganga from heaven to earth, others believe that the main story is of Kiratarjuniya or **Arjuna’s penance**
        2. **Ravana Shaking Mount Kailasha** - depicted several times in the **caves of Ellora** but the most **noteworthy** is depicted on **wall of Kailashnath temple** (cave number 16)
            
            1. Image is dated to the 8th century. It is a colossal sculpture and is considered as one of the masterpieces of Indian sculpture.
        3. **Lakshmana Temple at Khajuraho** - temples at Khajuraho are all made of **sandstone**. Patronized by the Chandela dynasty.
            
            1. Lakshamana temple represents the full- fledged, developed style of temple architecture during the time of the Chandelas. Its construction was completed by 954
            2. Many erotic sculptures are carved on the plinth wall ￼
8. Indian Bronze Sculpture -
    
    1. Sculptors had mastered the **bronze medium and the casting process** as much as they had mastered terracotta sculpture and carving in stone. **Cire-perdu or ‘lost-wax’** process for casting was learnt as long ago as the Indus Valley Culture. Along with it was discovered the process of making alloy of metals by mixing copper, zinc and tin which is called bronze.
        
        1. Bronze sculptures and statuettes of **Buddhist, Hindu and Jain** icons have been discovered from many regions of India **dating from the 2nd-16th** century.
        2. **Dancing Girl** in **tribhanga** posture from **Mohenjodaro** is the **earliest bronze sculpture** **datable to 2500 BCE.** Similar group of bronze statuettes have been discovered on archaeological excavation at Daimabad (Maharashtra) datable to 1500 BCE.

        5. Importance of the **Gupta and Vakataka (Amravati style, robe changed)** bronzes is that they were **portable and monks carried them** from place to place for the purpose of **individual worship or to be installed** in Buddhist viharas.
        6. Most of the images represent the **Jaina tirthankaras** like **Mahavira, Parshvanath or Adinath.** A new format was invented in which tirthankaras are seated on a throne; they can be **single or combined** in a group of three or in a group of twenty-four tirthankaras.

    2. Lost wax process - is a technique used for **making objects of metal**, especially in Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. In each region, a slightly different technique is used.
        
        1. Wax **model of the image** is made by hand. How? -> of pure beeswax that has first been melted over an open fire -> then strained through a fine cloth into a basin of cold water -> re-solidifies immediately -> pressed through a pichki or pharni — which squeezes the wax into noodle-like shape. These wax wires are then wound around to the shape of the entire image.
        2. Image is now covered with a thick coating of paste, made of equal parts of clay, sand and cow-dung.
        3. While the molten metal is poured in the clay pot, the clay-plastered model is exposed to firing. As the wax inside melts, the metal flows down the channel and takes on the shape of the wax image.
    3. Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir also produced bronze images of **Buddhist deities as well as Hindu** gods and goddesses; have a very distinct style.
        
        1. Four-headed Vishnu, also known as **Chaturanana** or **Vaikuntha Vishnu**, was worshipped
        2. **Narasimha avatar and Mahishasuramardini Durga** images of Himachal Pradesh are among the very dynamic bronzes

Example - **Avalokitesvara** (bodhisattva who **embodies** the compassion of all Buddhas), which is a good example of a male figure in graceful tribhanga posture. Worship of **female goddesses** was adopted which is **part of the growth of the Vajrayana phase in Buddhism. Images of** **Tara** **(female bodhisattva)** became very popular.
    5. Bronze casting technique and making of bronze images of **traditional icons reached a high stage** of development in South India during the **medieval** period
        
        1. Pallavas - **ardhaparyanka** (one leg kept dangling)
        ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020250424103700-5.tiff)3. **Nataraja** - (Chola bronzes) he has been **shown balancing himself on his right leg** and suppressing the **apasmara or muyalaka**, the demon of **ignorance**.

        4. **Kalyanasundara murti** is highly remarkable for the manner in which **Panigrahana (ceremony of marriage) is represented by two separate statuettes**. Union of Shiva and Parvati is very ingeniously represented in the **ardhanarisvara murti** in a single image.
        5. ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020250424103702-6.tiff) 10. Indo-Islamic
    
    1. By 8th century Muslims had begun constructing in Sind, Gujarat but **large scale building began with Turkish conquest of north India.**
        
        1. **Curved** form of construction was introduced gradually in which **arches** **could support the weight of the domes.**
        2. Mix of many structural techniques, stylized shapes, and surface decorations came about through **constant interventions,** known as **Indo-Saracenic or Indo-Islamic**
        3. Hindus adorned all surfaces with sculptures and paintings. **Muslims forbidden to** **replicate living forms** **on any surface**, developed their religious art and architecture consisting of the arts of arabesque, **geometrical** **patterns and** **calligraphy** **on plaster and stone.** #important
        4. In spite of the obvious Saracenic, Persian and Turkish influences, Indo-Islamic structures were **heavily influenced by** **prevailing** **sensibilities** of Indian architectural and decorative forms
    2. Study of Indo-Islamic architecture is conventionally categorized into the **Imperial** Style (Delhi Sultanate), the **Provincial** Style (Mandu, Gujarat, Bengal, and Jaunpur), the **Mughal** Style (Delhi, Agra, and Lahore) and **Deccani** Style (Bijapur, Golconda).
        
        1. Architectural influences - of **Bengal** and **Jaunpur** are distinct. 15th century white marble dargah of Shaikh Ahmad Khattu of Sarkhej is a good example of provincial style
        2. Decorative forms - These forms included **designing on plaster through incision or stucco.** Motifs included variety of flowers. Subsequently the techniques of **tessellation (mosaic designs) and pietra dura** were made use of for surface decoration particularly in the dado panels of the walls. At times **lapis lazuli (blue gemstone)** was used in the interior walls or on canopies. Other decorations included **arabesque, calligraphy** and high and low relief carving and a **profuse use of jalis.**
        3. Materials - walls in all buildings were **extremely thick** and were largely constructed of **rubble masonry,** which was easily available. Amazing **range** of **stones** were utilized for construction such as **quartzite, sandstone, buff, marble, etc**
        4. Forts - Building monumental forts with embattlements was a regular feature in medieval times, often **symbolizing the seat of power of a king.** Commanding heights were utilized to great advantage to construct forts. These heights gave a good perspective of the region, strategic advantage for security. **Chittorgarh** bears the distinction of being the **largest fort in Asia** and was occupied for the longest length of time as the seat of power.
        5. Minars - everyday **use of the minar was for the azaan or call to prayer**. Its phenomenal height, however, symbolized the might and power of the ruler. Qutub Minar was built in 13th century and is 234 feet high. **Chand Minar in Daulatabad** built in 15th century (by Bahmani) is a 210- feet-high tapering tower divided into four storeys.
        6. Tombs - **Monumental structures** over graves of rulers and royalty was a popular feature of medieval India. **Idea behind the tomb was eternal paradise** as a reward for the true believer on the Day of Judgement, which led to paradisiacal imagery for tomb construction
        7. Sarais - Sarais were largely built on a **simple square or rectangular plan** and were meant to provide **temporary accommodation to Indian and foreign travelers**, pilgrims, merchants, traders, etc. In effect, sarais were public domains which thronged with people of varied cultural backgrounds. This led to **cross-cultural interaction**, influences and syncretic tendencies. Dotted the vast space of sub-continent
    3. Some structures
        
        1. **Mandu** - city overlooks **Malwa plateau** to north and Narmada valley to south. **Hindola Mahal, Jahaaz Mahal** is in this city. Hoshang Shah's tomb is here as well.

4. Apart from the **circumambulatory path, gateways were added**. Thus, with the elaborations in stupa architecture, there was ample space for the architects and sculptors to plan **elaborations and to carve out images.**
5. ![Image result for stupa architecture](Exported%20image%2020250424103704-7.jpeg)
