**Class 6**

1. Food - **Vitamin A keeps our skin and eyes healthy**. Vitamin C helps body to **fight against many diseases (gets easily destroyed by heat during cooking)**. Vitamin D helps our body to **use calcium for bones and teeth**. Dietary fibres are also known as **roughage**. Roughage is mainly provided by **plant products in our foods.** Diseases that occur due to lack of nutrients over a long period are called deficiency diseases.

3. Fabrics are made up of yarns and **yarns are further made up of fibers**. Cotton and jute are examples of **fibers obtained from plants**. Wool and silk fibers are **obtained from animals**. Synthetic fibers are **polyester, nylon and acrylic.**
    
    1. Cotton - **boll is fruit of cotton,** fibers are separated from the **seeds by combing**. This process is called ginning of cotton
    2. Jute fiber is **obtained from stem** of the jute plant

Fabric from yarns is made by **weaving and knitting**. Process of arranging two sets of yarns together to make a fabric is called weaving. In knitting, a **single** yarn is used to make a piece of fabric

5. When the heavier component in a mixture settles after water is added to it, the process is called sedimentation. When the **water (along with the dust) is removed, the process is called decantation**. More of a substance can be **dissolved in a solution by heating it**
6. Most plants can be classified into three categories: **herbs, shrubs and trees**. Plants with weak stems that cannot stand upright and spread on the ground are called creepers, while those that take support on neighboring structures and climb up are called climbers. **Part of a leaf by which it is attached to the stem is called petiole.** The broad, **green part of the leaf is called lamina**
    
    1. Water **comes out of leaves in the form of vapor** by a process called transpiration. Plants release a lot of water into the air through this process.

Plants having leaves with **reticulate venation have tap roots** while plants having leaves with **parallel venation have fibrous roots.**

8. Muscles work in pairs. **When one of them contracts, the bone is pulled in that direction**. The other muscle of the pair relaxes. A muscle can only pull. **It cannot push.** Thus, two muscles have to work together to move a bone.
    
    1. **Earthworm does not have bones.** It has muscles which help to extend and shorten the body.
    2. **Snail shell is a single unit** and does not help in moving from place to place. It has to be **dragged along**. Snails move with the help of a muscular foot
    3. Cockroaches **walk and climb as well as fly in the air**. They have three pairs of legs
    4. Snakes have a **long backbone.** They have many thin muscles.
    5. Fish swim by **forming loops alternately** on two sides of the body
9. Adaptation -
    
    1. Desert plants l**ose very little water through transpiration**. The leaves in desert plants are either absent, very small, or they are **present in the shape of spines.** Photosynthesis in these plants is carried out by **stems**.
    2. Mountains - trees are **normally cone shaped and have sloping branches**. The leaves of some of these trees are needle-like. This **helps the rainwater and snow to slide off** easily.
    3. Dolphins breathe in air **through nostrils or blowholes** that are located on the upper parts of their heads. This allows them to breathe in air when they swim near the surface of water.
    4. In aquatic plants, **roots are much reduced in size and their main function is to hold the plant in place**. Stems of these plants are long, hollow and light. The stems grow up to the surface of water while the leaves and flowers, float on the surface of the water
    5. Some animals may have different mechanisms for the exchange of gases, which is a part of the respiration process. For example, **earthworms breathe through their skin**. Fish have gills for using oxygen dissolved in water
    6. Respiration is a process that **takes place in seeds** even when some of the other life processes may not be very active
10. Plants
    
    1. Plants can be classified into three categories: **herbs, shrubs and trees.**
        
        1. Plants with **green and tender stems** are called herbs. They are usually **short** and may not have many branches
        2. Some plants have the **stem branching out near the base**. The stem is **hard** but not very thick. Such plants are called shrubs
        3. Plants with weak stems that **cannot stand upright** and **spread on the ground** are called creepers, while **those that take support on neighbouring structure**s and climb up are called climbers
    2. Pattern of veins on the leaf is called **venation**. It can be reticulate or parallel
    3. Plants having leaves with reticulate venation have tap roots while plants having leaves with parallel venation have fibrous roots.
    4. The part of a leaf by which it is attached to the stem is called petiole. The broad, green part of the leaf is called lamina
    5. Water comes out of leaves in the form of vapor by a process called transpiration. Plants release a lot of water into the air through this process
    6. We eat some of food stored plant in roots— like **carrot, radish, sweet potato, turnip and tapioca**
11. Body movement
    
    1. **Bones and cartilage form the skeleton** of the human body. It gives the frame and shape to the body and helps in movement. It **protects the inner organs.**
    2. The joint where our **neck joins the head is a pivotal joint.** Parts of the skeleton that are not as hard as the bones and which **can be bent are called cartilage.**
    3. When contracted, the muscle becomes shorter, stiffer and thicker. It can **only pull the bone.** Bones are moved by alternate contractions and relaxations of two sets of muscles.
    4. **Strong muscles and light bones** work together to help the birds fly. They fly by flapping their wings
    5. Fish swim by **forming loops alternately** on two sides of the body
    6. Snakes slither on the ground by looping sideways. A large number of bones and associated muscles push the body forward
    7. The body and legs of **cockroaches** have hard coverings **forming an outer skeleton**. The muscles of the breast connected with **three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings** help the cockroach to walk and fly.
    8. Earthworms move by alternate extension and contraction of the body **using muscles.** Tiny bristles on the underside of the body help in gripping the ground.
    9. Snails move with the **help of a muscular foot.**
    10. **Mandible bone which forms the lower jaw is the only skull bone that is movable.** #remember-for-later
12. Living organisms and habitats
    
    1. Desert - animals like rats and snakes, which do not have long legs that a camel has. **To stay away from the intense heat during the day**, they stay in burrows deep in the sand
        
        1. leaves in desert plants are either absent, very small, or they are in the form of **spines**. This helps in **reducing loss of water** from the leaves through transpiration.
        2. stem is also covered with a **thick waxy layer**, which helps to retain water in the tissues of cacti.
    2. Mountains
        
        1. trees are normally **cone shaped and have sloping branches**. The leaves of some of these trees are needle-like. This helps the rainwater and snow to slide off easily.
    3. Grasslands
        
        1. Lions have eyes in front of the face allow it to have a correct idea about the location of its prey
        2. Deer have long ears to hear movements of predators. The eyes on the side of its head allow it to look in all directions for danger.
    4. Aquatic
        
        1. In plants, roots are much reduced in size and their **main function is to hold the plant in place**
        2. stems of these plants are long, hollow and light. The stems grow up to the surface of water while the leaves and flowers, float on the surface of water.
    5. Respiration is a process that takes **place in seeds even** when some of the other life processes **may not be very active (such as in a sack of wheat).**
13. Measurement
    
    1. A cubit as the length from the **elbow to the finger tips was used in ancient Egypt.** In ancient India, small length measurements used were an angul (finger) or a mutthi (fist).
    2. Motion in a straight line is called **rectilinear motion.** In circular motion an object moves such that its distance from a fixed point remains the same. Motion that repeats itself after some period of time is called periodic motion
14. Light travels in **straight lines and so cannot move around an object that is in its path.** The result is a dark area or shadow wherever an object blocks light. Mirror reflection gives us clear images #remember-for-later
15. Electricity
    
    1. All electric cells have two terminals; a **positive terminal and a negative terminal**. In an electric circuit, the **direction** of current is taken to be from the **positive to the negative** terminal of the electric cell
    2. Thin wire that gives off light is called the filament of the bulb.
16. Magnets
    
    1. Freely suspended bar magnet **always comes to rest in a particular direction, which is the North-South direction**
    2. Iron, nickel, cobalt are **magnetic** in nature.
    3. Opposite poles of two magnets attract each other whereas **similar poles repel one another.**
    4. **Cassette tapes, video tapes and floppy disks** are just a few examples of storage devices that use magnetic tape to store data. Because they use this type of tape, a **magnet can erase** or damage data stored on them.
17. Water - ok
18. Air - Air in motion is called **wind**. Air occupies space. Air is present in water and soil. Air is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapor and a few other gases and dust particles
    
    1. Why do earthworms come out mostly during rains?
19. Solid waste -
    
    1. Blue bin is for materials that can be **used again** — such as plastics, metals and glass. Green bins are for collecting **kitchen** and other plant or animal wastes
    2. Method of preparing compost with the help of **redworms is called vermicomposting. Redworms do not have teeth.** They have a structure called ‘gizzard’, which helps them in grinding their food￼

**Class 7**

1. Nutrition in plants
    
    1. Plants are the **only organisms that can prepare food for themselves**. Leaves are the food factories of plants. The synthesis of food in plants **occurs in leaves**. Carbon dioxide from air is taken in through the tiny pores present on the surface of the leaves. These **pores are surrounded by ‘guard cells’. Such pores are called stomata.** Chlorophyll helps leaves to capture the energy of the sunlight. **Sun is the ultimate source of energy for all living organisms**
    2. Besides leaves, photosynthesis also takes place in other **green parts of the plant — in green stems and green branches.** During photosynthesis, oxygen is released. The **carbohydrates ultimately get converted into starch**. The presence of starch in leaves indicates the occurrence of photosynthesis. The starch is also a carbohydrate.
    3. The **leaves other than green also have chlorophyll. The large amount of red, brown and other pigments mask the green color**. There are some plants which **do not have chlorophyll (amarbel).**
    4. Mode of nutrition in which organisms take in nutrients in solution form from dead and decaying matter is called saprotrophic nutrition. Plants which use saprotrophic mode of nutrition are called saprotrophs.
    5. **In lichens, a chlorophyll-containing partner, which is an alga, and a fungus live together. Alga prepares the food.**
    6. Carbohydrates are made of **carbon, hydrogen and oxygen**. These are used to synthesize other components of food such as **proteins and fats**. But **proteins are nitrogenous substances** which contain nitrogen.
    7. The bacterium called Rhizobium can take **atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into a soluble form. But Rhizobium cannot make its own food**. So it lives in the roots of gram, peas, moong, beans and other legumes and provides them with nitrogen.
2. Nutrition in animals
    
    1. Breakdown of **complex components of food into simpler substances is called digestion.** Starfish feeds on animals covered by hard shells of calcium carbonate.
    2. Digestion in humans - through **alimentary canal.** The inner walls of the stomach and the small intestine, and the various glands associated with the canal such as **salivary glands, the liver and the pancreas secrete digestive juices.** The digestive tract and the associated glands together constitute the digestive system.
    3. The tongue is a **fleshy muscular organ** attached at the back to the floor of the buccal cavity. It is free at the front and can be moved in all directions. Inside the throat, **air and food share a common passage**
    4. Food is pushed down by **movement of the wall of the food pipe**. The inner lining of the stomach secretes **mucous, hydrochloric acid and digestive juices**. The mucous protects the lining of the stomach. The acid kills many bacteria that enter along with the food and makes the medium in the **stomach acidic and helps the digestive juices to act.** The digestive juices break down the **proteins into simpler substances.**
    5. Small intestine is **highly coiled and is about 7.5m long**. It receives secretions from the **liver and the pancreas.** Besides, its wall also secretes juices. Liver is the **largest gland in the body**; secretes bile juice that is stored in a sac called the **gall bladder, plays an important role in the digestion of fats.**
    6. Lower part of the small intestine is where the intestinal juice completes the digestion of **all components of the food.** The carbohydrates get broken into **simple sugars such as glucose, fats into fatty acids and glycerol, and proteins into amino acids**
    7. The inner walls of the small intestine have thousands of finger-like outgrowths. **These are called villi; increase the surface area for absorption of the digested food.** Large intestine is **wider and shorter** than small intestine. It is about 1.5m in length. Its function is to **absorb water and some salts** from the undigested food material.
    8. Cows quickly **swallow the grass (rich in cellulose, humans can't digest)** and store it in part of stomach called rumen. It gets partially digested and is called cud. Later the cud returns to the mouth in small lumps and the animal chews it. This process is called **rumination** and these animals are called ruminants.
    9. Amoeba ingests its food with the help of its **false feet or pseudopodia**. The food is digested in the food vacuole.
3. Fiber to fabric
    
    1. **Air is a poor conductor of heat**. **Hair trap a lot of air**. Yak wool is common in Tibet and Ladakh. Angora wool is obtained from **angora goats, found in hilly regions such as J&K**. Natural fleece of sheep and goats is black, brown or white in color.
    2. ![Table 3.1 Some Indian breeds of sheep .No. Name of breed 1. 2. 3. 4. Lohi Ram ur bushair Nah Bakharwal Quality of wool Good quality wool Brown fleece Carpet wool For woollen shawls State whe Rajasthan Uttar Pradt Rajasthan Jammu ](Exported%20image%2020250424103510-0.tiff)
    3. Wool sorter’s job is risky as sometimes they get infected by a **bacterium, anthrax,** which causes a fatal blood disease called sorter’s disease.
    4. Silk fibers are also animal fibers. **Soft silk yarn is as strong as a comparable thread of steel**. Silk yarn (thread) is obtained from the **cocoon of the silk moth**. Silkworms are caterpillars of silk moth. The process of taking out threads from the cocoon for use as silk is called **reeling the silk.** Most common silk moth is the **mulberry silk moth**.
4. Heat
    
    1. Clinical thermometer is designed to measure the **temperature of human body only**. The temperature of human body normally does not **go below 35°C or above 42°C.** Kink in thermometer **prevents mercury level from falling on its own.** The normal temperature of human body is 37°C. Range of a laboratory thermometer is generally **from –10°C to 110°C.**
        
        1. “Dry bulb” instrument, records the temperature of the air. “Wet bulb” thermometer, measures **relative humidity in the air** and the results are normally lower than just the pure air temperature. At 100% relative humidity, the wet-bulb temperature is equal to the air temperature (dry-bulb temperature) and is lower at lower humidity.
        2. If **wet bulb temperatures in our environment are at 35°C or greater, our ability to lose heat declines rapidly** and even the fittest of people would die in around 6 hours.
    2. Materials which allow heat to pass through them easily are conductors of heat. For examples, aluminum, iron and copper. The materials which do not allow heat to pass through them easily are poor conductors of heat such as plastic and wood. Poor conductors are known as insulators.
    3. Heat flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower temperature. There are three ways in which heat can flow from one object to another. These are **conduction, convection and radiation**. **All hot bodies radiate heat.** When this heat falls on some object, a part of it is reflected, a part is absorbed and a part may be transmitted.
5. Acid, bases, salts
    
    1. Curd, lemon juice, orange juice and vinegar taste sour. These substances taste sour because they contain acids.
    2. Substances like baking soda which are **bitter in taste and feel soapy** on touching are known as bases. The nature of such substances is said to be basic.
    3. Special type of substances are used to test whether a substance is acidic or basic. These substances are known as **indicators**. The indicators change their color when added to a solution containing an acidic or a basic substance.
    4. ![DO you Name of acid Acetic acid Formic acid Citric acid Lactic acid Oxalic acid Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) Tartaric acid All the know? Found in Vinegar Ant's sting Citrus fruit as oranges, lemons, etc Curd Spinach Amla, Citru Tamarind, unripe mar acids mentioned above occur in nature Name of base Found in ](Exported%20image%2020250424103515-1.tiff)
    5. Most commonly used natural indicator is **litmus. It is extracted from lichens.**
    6. Rain containing **excess of acids is called an acid rain.** Rain becomes acidic because **carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide** (which are released into the air as pollutants) dissolve in rain drops to form carbonic acid, sulphuric acid and nitric acid respectively.
    7. The reaction between an acid and a base is known as **neutralization**. **Salt and water are produced in this process with the evolution of heat**
        
        1. Our stomach contains hydrochloric acid. To relieve indigestion, we take an **antacid** such as milk of magnesia, which contains **magnesium hydroxide.**
        2. When an ant bites, it injects the acidic liquid (**formic acid**) into the skin. The effect of the acid can be neutralized by rubbing moist baking soda
        3. When the soil is too acidic, it is treated with **bases like quick lime** (calcium oxide) or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide). **If the soil is basic, organic matter is added to it.** #important
6. Physical and chemical changes
    
    1. Rust is not iron (**iron oxide**). For rusting, the **presence of both oxygen and water (or water vapor) is essential.** This process of depositing a layer of zinc on iron is called galvanization. **Stainless steel is made by mixing iron with carbon and metals like chromium, nickel and manganese. It does not rust.**
7. Weather and climate
    
    1. All the **changes in the weather are driven by the sun.** Rainfall is measured by an **instrument called the rain gauge.**
    2. Polar bears are so **well-insulated that they have to move slowly** and rest often to avoid getting overheated.
    3. **Birds must remain warm to survive**. They migrate to warmer regions when winter sets in.
    4. Some evidence that birds may use the **magnetic field of the earth to find direction**. And it is not only birds that migrate; mammals, many types of fish and insects are also known to migrate seasonally in search of more hospitable climates
    5. **Lion-tailed macaque (also called Beard ape)** lives in the rainforests of Western Ghats. Its most outstanding feature is the silver-white mane, which surrounds the head from the cheeks down to its chin. It **rarely comes down on the ground**
8. Winds and storms
    
    1. **Increased wind speed is accompanied by a reduced air pressure.** Air moves from the region where the air pressure is high to the region where the pressure is low. The greater the difference in pressure, the faster the air moves.
    2. On heating the **air expands and occupies more space.** When the same thing occupies more space, it **becomes lighter. The warm air is, therefore, lighter than the cold air. That is the reason that the smoke goes up.**
    3. Wind currents are generated due to **uneven heating on the earth.**
        
        1. Uneven heating between the **equator and the poles**
        2. Uneven heating of **land and water**
    4. Thunderstorms develop in **hot, humid tropical areas like India** very frequently. The rising temperatures produce **strong upward rising winds**. These winds carry **water droplets upwards, where they freeze,** and fall down again. Swift movement of the falling water droplets along with the rising air create lightning and sound.
9. Soil
    
    1. The rotting dead matter in the **soil is called humus.**
    2. If soil contains greater **proportion of big particles it is called sandy soil**. If the proportion of fine particles is relatively higher**, then it is called clayey soil**. If the amount of large and fine particles is about the same, then the **soil is called loamy**. (sandy > loamy > clayey)
    3. Sand is **well aerated**. Water can drain quickly through the spaces between the sand particles. So, sandy soils tend to be light, well aerated and rather dry.
    4. Clay particles, being much smaller, **pack tightly together, leaving little space for air**. Unlike sandy soil, water can be held in the tiny gaps between the particles of clay. So **clay soils have little air. But they are heavy as they hold more water than the sandy soils.**
    5. Best topsoil for growing plants is loam. Loamy soil is a mixture of sand, clay and another type of soil particle known as silt. Silt occurs as a deposit in river beds. The size of the silt particles is between those of sand and clay. #remember-for-later
    6. Clayey and loamy soils are **both suitable for growing cereals like wheat, and gram**.
    7. For paddy, soils **rich in clay and organic matter** and having a good capacity to retain water are ideal. For lentils (masoor) and other pulses, loamy soils, which **drain water easily, are required.**
    8. Crops such as **wheat are grown in the fine clayey soils**, because they are rich in humus and are very fertile.
    9. Percolation rate of water is different in different types of soil. It is highest in the sandy soil and least in the clayey soil.
10. Respiration
    
    1. In the cells, **oxygen in the air helps in the breakdown of food**. The process of breakdown of food in the cell with the **release of energy is called cellular respiration**. Cellular respiration takes place in the **cells of all organisms.**
    2. When breakdown of glucose occurs with the use of oxygen it is called aerobic respiration. Food can also be broken down, without using oxygen. This is called anaerobic respiration. **In the absence of oxygen, glucose breaks down into alcohol and carbon dioxide.**
        
        1. Yeasts are single-celled organisms. They r**espire anaerobically and during this process yield alcohol. They are used to make wine and beer**
        2. Anaerobic respiration takes **places in the muscle cells to fulfil the demand of energy**, releasing lactic acid.
    3. Breathing means **taking in air rich in oxygen** and giving out air rich in carbon dioxide with the help of respiratory organs. **Inhaled air is by volume 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and small amounts** include argon, carbon dioxide, neon, helium, and hydrogen. The **gas exhaled is 4-5% by volume of carbon dioxide,** about a 100 fold increase over the inhaled amount (oxygen comes down by 4-5%)
    4. In earthworm, the **exchange of gases occurs through the moist skin.** In fishes it takes place through **gills** and in insects through the **tracheae** (spiracles). In plants **each part can independently take in oxygen from the air and give out carbon dioxide.**
11. Transportation in animals
    
    1. Blood is the fluid which **flows in blood vessels**. It **transports substances like digested food** from the small intestine to the other parts of the body. F**luid part of the blood is called plasma.** One type of cells are the red blood cells (RBC) which contain a **red pigment called haemoglobin**. **Haemoglobin binds with oxygen and transports it to all the parts of the body and ultimately to all the cells.**
    2. **Clot** is formed because of the presence of another type of cells in the **blood called platelets. Only in mammals.**
    3. Arteries carry **oxygen-rich blood from the heart** to all parts of the body. Since the blood flow is rapid and at a **high pressure**, the arteries have **thick elastic walls.** Veins are the vessels which carry carbon dioxide-rich blood from all parts of the body back to the heart. The **veins have thin walls.** There are valves present in veins which allow blood to flow **only** towards the heart.
        
        1. On reaching the tissues, arteries divide further into **extremely thin tubes called capillaries**. The **capillaries join up to form veins** which empty into the heart.
    4. Animals such as **sponges and Hydra do not posses any circulatory system.**
    5. Urine consists of **95% water, 2.5% urea and 2.5% other waste** products. Fish **excrete waste substances such as ammonia which directly dissolve in water**
    6. **Root hair increase the surface area** of the root for the absorption of water and mineral nutrients dissolved in water. Nutrients are transported **along with water to the entire plant via the vascular tissue called xylem**. The vascular tissue for the transport of **food to the various parts of the plant is phloem.**
12. Reproduction in plants - covered in class 12
    
    1. There are several methods of asexual reproduction such as **fragmentation, budding, spore formation and vegetative propagation**. Plants such as **moss and ferns reproduce by means of spores.**
    2. Flowers which contain either **only the pistil or only the stamens** are called unisexual flowers. The flowers which contain both stamens and pistil are called **bisexual** flowers
    3. **Pollen grains have a tough protective coat** which prevents them from drying up.
    4. Seed dispersal is aided by **wind, water and animals.** Seed dispersal helps the plants to (i) prevent overcrowding, (ii) avoid competition for sunlight, water and minerals and (iii) invade new habitats
13. Motion and time - ok
14. Current
    
    1. When an **electric current flows through a wire, the wire gets heated. It is the heating effect of current**. This effect has many applications.
    2. When **electric current passes through a wire, it behaves like a magnet. This is the magnetic effect of the electric current.**
15. Light
    
    1. Light **travels along straight lines**.
    2. An image which can be obtained on a **screen is called a real image**. An image which cannot be obtained on a screen is called a virtual image
    3. Image formed by a **plane mirror is erect.** It is virtual and is of the **same size as the object**. The image is at the **same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of it.**
    4. **Convex mirror uses - side view mirror in cars, accidental security mirror****￼****Concave mirror uses - telescope, shaving mirrors, reflectors in head light**
    5. ![I. 2. 3. 4. Convex mirror is a spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is away from the centre of the sphere of which the mirror is a art. The focus lies behind the mirror. Convex mirror is known as a diverging mirror. I. 2. 3. 4. Concave mirror is whose reflecting s the centre of the the mirror is The focus lies infi Concave mirror converging ](Exported%20image%2020250424103516-2.tiff)
    6. A convex lens converges (bends inward) the light generally falling on it, called a converging lens. A convex lens can form real and inverted image. When the object is placed very close to the lens, the image formed is virtual, erect and magnified. When used to see objects magnified, the convex lens is called a magnifying glass.
    7. On the other hand, a concave lens diverges (bends outward) the light and is called a diverging lens. Image formed by a concave lens is always virtual, erect and smaller in size than the object
    8. Sunlight consists of seven colors. The sunlight is said to be **white light. This means that the white light consists of seven colors**
16. Water - ok
17. Forests - ok￼

**Class 8**

1. Crop production
    
    1. **Loosened soil helps in the growth of earthworms** and microbes present in the soil. Hoe is a simple tool which is used for removing weeds and for loosening the soil.
    2. **Fertilizer is an inorganic salt, doesn't provide any humus to the soil.**
    3. The best time for the removal of weeds is **before they produce flowers and seeds.** Weedicides are sprayed during the **vegetative growth of weeds** before flowering and seed formation. Spraying of weedicides may affect the health of farmers.
    4. **Dried neem leaves are used for storing food grains at home.**
2. Microorganisms
    
    1. Microorganisms are **classified into 4 major groups**. These groups are **bacteria, fungi, protozoa and some algae**. Viruses are also microscopic. They, however, **reproduce only inside the cells of the host organism, which may be a bacterium, plant or animal.**

9. Reproduction -
    
    1. In many animals **fertilisation takes place outside the body of the female**, in water
    2. Cloning is the production of an exact copy of a cell, any other living part, or a complete organism. **Dolly the sheep, first mammal to be cloned.**
    3. Amoeba reproduces by **dividing itself into two**. This type of asexual reproduction is called binary fission

    2. Reproductive life of a woman lasts from **menarche to menopause**
    3. When a sperm containing **X chromosome fertilizes the egg**, the zygote would have two X chromosomes and develop into a female child. If the sperm contributes a Y chromosome to the egg (ovum) at fertilisation, the zygote would develop into a male child.
    4. Adrenal glands secrete hormones which maintain the **correct salt balance in the blood**. Adrenals also produce the hormone **adrenalin**. Pituitary gland secretes hormones which include **growth hormone and hormones that make other glands** such as testes, ovaries, thyroids and adrenals, secrete hormones.

    2. Force due to air in a column of the height of the atmosphere and area 15 cm × 15 cm is nearly equal to the **force of gravity on an object of mass 225 kg.** The reason we are not crushed under this force of gravity is that the **pressure inside our bodies is also equal to the atmospheric pressure and balances the pressure from outside.**
12. Friction
    
    1. If an object started moving, **it would never stop if there were no friction.** Friction opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact. It **acts on both the surfaces**
    2. Sliding friction comes into play when an object is sliding over another. Sliding friction is smaller than static friction. When one body rolls over another body, rolling friction comes into play. Rolling friction is smaller than sliding friction. (**rolling < sliding < static**)
    3. ![Types of Friction • Static friction • Sliding friction • Rolling friction No motion Sliding motion Force Force ](Exported%20image%2020250424103521-4.tiff)
    4. Fluid friction can be **minimized by giving suitable shapes to bodies** moving in fluids.
13. Sound
    
    1. In humans, **sound is produced by the voice box or the larynx. Two vocal cords, are stretched across the voice box or larynx** in such a way that it leaves a narrow slit between them for the passage of air. When the **lungs force air through the slit, the vocal cords vibrate, producing sound.**
    2. Vibrating objects **produce sound and it is carried in all directions in a medium**. The medium could be a gas, a liquid or a solid. Speed at which sound propagates (or travels from its source) is directly influenced by both the medium through which it travels and the factors affecting the medium, such as altitude, humidity and temperature for gases like air. **Fastest in solids than liquids; worst in air. Best in diamonds.**
    3. Sound **cannot travel through a vacuum. A vacuum is an area without any air, like space.** So sound cannot travel through space because there is **no matter for the vibrations to work in.**
    4. The **frequency determines the shrillness or pitch of a sound.** If the frequency of vibration is higher we say that the sound is **shrill and has a higher pitch.** If the frequency of vibration is lower, we say that the sound has a lower pitch.
    5. Usually the voice of a **woman has a higher frequency than that of a man (also means man's pitch is low**). A bird makes a high-pitched sound whereas a **lion makes a low-pitched roar.** However, the roar of a lion is very loud while the sound of the bird is quite feeble.
    6. For human ear, the **range of audible frequencies is roughly from 20 to 20,000 Hz. Dog whistles and ultrasound equipment works at >20,000 Hz.**
    7. **Total hearing impairment, which is rare, is usually from birth itself**. Partial disability is generally the result of a disease, injury or age.
14. Electric current
    
    1. Some liquids are good conductors of electricity and some are poor conductors. **Water from taps, ponds is not pure and a good conductor of electricity. Distilled water is free of salts (no ions) and is a poor conductor**.
    2. Common salt, when dissolved in distilled water, makes it a good conductor. **Most liquids that conduct electricity are solutions of acids, bases and salts**
    3. Process of depositing a **layer of any desired metal on another material** by means of electricity is called **electroplating**. It is one of the most common applications of chemical effects of electric current.
15. Natural phenomena
    
    1. The **electrical charges generated by rubbing are static.** They do not move by themselves. When **charges move, they constitute an electric current**. Process of transferring of charge from a **charged object to the earth is called earthing.**
    2. During the development of a thunderstorm, the **air currents move upward while the water droplets move downward. These vigorous movements cause separation of charges.**
        
        1. Positive charges **collect near the upper edges** of the clouds and the **negative charges accumulate near the lower edges.** There is accumulation of positive charges near the ground also
        2. When the magnitude of the accumulated charges becomes very large, the air which is normally a poor conductor of electricity, is no longer able to resist their flow. **Negative and positive charges meet, producing streaks of bright light and sound**
        3. During a thunderstorm, **safer to use mobile phones and cordless phones than wired phones. Bathing should be avoided during thunderstorms to avoid contact with running water**
16. Light
    
    1. Laws of reflection -
        
        1. Angle of incidence is **always equal to the angle of reflection.**
        2. **Incident ray, the normal at the point of incidence and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane**
    2. Image formed by a mirror the left of the object appears on the right and the right appears on the left. This is known as **lateral inversion**
    3. When all the parallel rays reflected from a rough or irregular surface are not parallel, the reflection is known as **diffused** or irregular reflection.
    4. Sunlight, called white light, consists of seven colors. **Splitting of light into its constituent colors is known as dispersion.**
    5. The **iris is that part of eye which gives it its distinctive color. The iris controls the amount of light entering into the eye.**
    6. The retina contains several **nerve cells. Sensations felt by the nerve cells are then transmitted to the brain through the optic nerve**. There are two kinds of cells– (i) **cones, which are sensitive to bright light and (ii) rods, which are sensitive to dim light. Cones sense color**. At the **junction of the optic nerve and the retina, there are no sensory cells, so no vision** is possible at that spot. This is called the blind spot.
    7. Eyes of a crab are quite small but they **enable the crab to look all around.** So, the **crab can sense even if the enemy approaches from behind**. Butterflies have large eyes that seem to be made up of **thousands of little eyes**
17. Solar system
    
    1. The time period between **one full moon to the next full moon is slightly longer than 29 days.** In many calendars this period is called a month
    2. Stars are present in the **sky during the day-time also.** However, they are not visible then because of the bright sunlight. **Stars appear to move from east to west.**
    3. Pole star appears to be **stationary from the Earth, because it is situated close to the direction of the axis of rotation of the Earth.**
    4. Constellation **appears to move in the sky from east to west**
        
        1. **Ursa Major can be seen in summer in early part of the night**, Ursa Major is **visible throughout the year from most of the northern hemisphere**

￼**Chemistry - Class 12 - Unit 16****￼**

1. Medicines - drugs are **chemicals of low molecular masses**, when they interact with **macromolecular targets and produce a useful biological response.** Use of chemicals for therapeutic effect is chemotherapy.
2. Can be classified as -
    
    1. On basis of **pharmacological effect -** e.g. analgesics have pain killing effect and antiseptics kill growth of microorganisms
    2. On basis of **drug action** - on particular biochemical process.
    3. On basis of **chemical structure** - share common structural features
    4. On basis of **molecular targets** - Drugs usually interact with biomolecules such as carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. These are called **target molecules or drug targets.**
3. **Macromolecules** of **biological origin perform various functions** in the body. For example
    
    1. **proteins** which perform the role of **biological catalysts** in the body are called **enzymes**
    2. those which are crucial to **communication** system in the body are called **receptors**
    3. **Carrier proteins carry polar molecules** across the cell membrane.
    4. **Nucleic acids have coded genetic** information for the cell.
    5. **Lipids and carbohydrates are structural parts of the cell membrane.**
4. Drug target interaction - **enzymes as drug targets**
    
    1. Catalytic action of enzymes - 1st function of an **enzyme is to hold the substrate for a chemical reaction**. **Active sites of enzymes hold the substrate molecule in a suitable position**, so that it can be attacked by the reagent effectively. Substrates bind to the active site of the enzyme through a variety of interactions such as **ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interaction or dipole-dipole interaction**. 2nd function is to provide **functional groups that will attack the substrate** and carry out chemical reaction
    2. Drug-enzyme interaction - Drugs **inhibit any of the above mentioned activities of enzymes.** These can **block the binding site of the enzyme** and prevent the binding of substrate, or can inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Such drugs are called **enzyme inhibitors.** Drugs can compete with natural substrate (competitive inhibitors) or bind to sites called allosteric sites (**changes the shape of active site)**.
5. Drug target interaction - Receptors as drug targets - **receptors are proteins that are crucial to body's communication process**
    
    1. Receptor protein **embedded in the cell membrane**, the active site of the receptor opens on the outside region of the cell. In the body, message between two neurons and that between **neurons to muscles is communicated through certain chemicals.**
    2. These chemicals, known as chemical messengers are **received at the binding sites of receptor proteins**. To accommodate a messenger, **shape of the receptor site changes.** This brings about the transfer of message into the cell. Thus, chemical messenger gives **message to the cell without entering the cell.**
    3. Drugs that bind to the **receptor site and inhibit its natural function are called antagonists**, useful when blocking of message is required. There are other types of drugs that mimic the natural messenger by switching on the receptor, called **agonists**. Useful when there is l**ack of natural chemical messenger.**
6. Therapeutic action of classes of drugs
    
    1. **Antacids** - over production of **acid in stomach causes irritation and pain**. A major breakthrough in the treatment of hyperacidity came through the discovery according to which a chemical, **histamine** (culprit), **stimulates the secretion of pepsin and hydrochloric acid** in the stomach. The drug cimetidine was designed to prevent the interaction of histamine with the receptors present in the stomach wall. This resulted in release of lesser amount of acid.
    2. **Antihistamines** - Histamine is also responsible for the **nasal congestion associated with common cold and allergic response to pollen**. Antihistamines interfere with natural action of histamines by **competing with histamine for binding sites of receptor** where histamine exerts its effect.
    3. Neurologically active drugs -
        
        1. Tranquilizers - **Tranquilizers and analgesics are neurologically active drugs**. These affect the message **transfer mechanism from nerve to receptor.** Tranquilizers are a class of chemical compounds used for the treatment of stress, and mild or even severe mental diseases. These **relieve anxiety, stress,** irritability or excitement by inducing a sense of well-being. They form an essential component of **sleeping pills.**
        2. Analgesics - Analgesics **reduce or abolish pain without causing impairment** of consciousness, mental confusion, incoordination or paralysis or some other disturbances of nervous system. Two types
            
            1. Non-narcotic - **such as Aspirin, paracetamol**. Effective in relieving skeletal pain such as due to arthritis.
            2. Narcotic - **Morphine and many of its homologues**, when administered in medicinal doses, relieve pain and produce sleep. In poisonous doses, these produce stupor, coma, convulsions and ultimately death. Morphine narcotics are sometimes referred to as **opiates**, since they are obtained from the opium poppy.
    4. Antimicrobials - tends to **destroy/prevent development or inhibit the pathogenic action of microbes** such as bacteria (antibacterial drugs), fungi (antifungal agents), virus (antiviral agents), or other parasites (anti-parasitic drugs) selectively. **Antibiotics, antiseptics and disinfectants** are antimicrobial drugs.
        
        1. Antibiotics - are used as **drugs to treat infections because of low toxicity** for humans and animals. Antibiotic now refers to a substance produced wholly or partly by chemical synthesis, which in **low concentrations inhibits the growth or destroys microorganisms by intervening in their metabolic processes**. Antibiotics which kill or inhibit a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are said to be **broad spectrum antibiotics**. Those effective mainly against Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria are narrow spectrum antibiotics. If effective **against a single organism** or disease, they are referred to as **limited spectrum antibiotics.**
        2. Antiseptics and disinfectants - chemicals which **either kill or prevent the growth of microorganisms.** Antiseptics are **applied to the living tissues such as wounds, cuts**, ulcers and diseased skin surfaces. **Iodine is a powerful antiseptic**. Its 2-3% solution in alcohol- water mixture is known as _tincture of iodin_e. ￼Disinfectants are applied to inanimate objects such as floors, drainage system, instruments, etc. Same substances can **act as an antiseptic as well as disinfectant by varying the concentration**
    
    Antibiotic revolution has provided long and healthy life to people. The life expectancy has almost doubled.
    
7. Chemical in foods - Chemicals are added to food for **(i) their preservation, (ii) enhancing their appeal, and (iii) adding nutritive value in them.**
    
    1. **Saccharin is 1st popular artificial sweetener.** Use of **aspartame** (most successful) is limited to cold foods and soft drinks because it is **unstable at cooking temperature.**
    2. Food preservatives **prevent spoilage of food due to microbial growth**. The most commonly used preservatives include **table salt, sugar, vegetable oils and sodium benzoate**
    3. Detergents - Two types of detergents are used as cleansing agents. These are **soaps and synthetic detergents**. These improve cleansing properties of water. These help in removal of fats which bind other materials to the fabric or skin. **Only sodium and potassium soaps are soluble in water** and are used for cleaning purposes. Basically all soaps are made by **boiling fats or oils with suitable soluble hydroxide.** Variations are made by using different raw materials. ￼Hard water contains **calcium and magnesium ions****.** These ions form **insoluble calcium and magnesium soaps respectively when sodium or potassium soaps are dissolved in hard water.**
        
        1. Synthetic detergent - are cleansing agents which have all the **properties of soaps, but which actually do not contain any soap.** These can be used both in soft and hard water as they give foam even in hard water. three main categories, namely: **anionic, cationic and non-ionic****,** and each category has its specific uses. **Detergents with** **straight** **chain of hydrocarbons are** **preferred** **over branched chain as the latter are non-biodegradable a**nd consequently cause environmental pollution. ￼

**Biology Class 12****￼**

1. **Chapter 1 - Reproduction in organisms**
    
    1. Whatever be the life span, death of every individual organism is a certainty, i.e., no individual is immortal, except single-celled organisms. Reproduction is defined as a biological process in which an organism gives rise to offspring similar to itself. Organism’s habitat, its internal physiology and several other factors are collectively responsible for how it reproduces
    2. When offspring is produced by a single parent with or without the involvement of gamete formation, the reproduction is asexual. When two parents (opposite sex) participate in the reproductive process and also involve fusion of male and female gametes, it is called sexual reproduction.
    3. Asexual - offspring produced are exact copies of their parent. E.g. budding in yeast, binary fission in amoeba. Members of the kingdom fungi and simple plants such as algae reproduce through special asexual reproductive structures
        
        1. In plants, the units of vegetative propagation such as runner, rhizome, sucker, tuber, offset, bulb are all capable of giving rise to new offspring. These structures are called vegetative propagules. Obviously, since the formation of these structures does not involve two parents, the process involved is asexual.
        2. Algae and fungi can shift to sexual method of reproduction just before the onset of adverse conditions
    4. Sexual - involves formation of the male and female gametes, either by the same individual or by different individuals of the opposite sex. These gametes fuse to form the zygote which develops to form the new organism.
        
        1. All organisms have to reach a certain stage of growth and maturity in their life, before they can reproduce sexually. That period of growth is called juvenile phase/vegetative phase.
        2. Neelakurinji is a shrub found in shola forests of WG. Nilgiri hills got its name from blue flowers of this plant which flowers only once in 12 years.
    5. Events in sexual reproduction - sequential events may be grouped into three distinct stages namely
        
        1. pre-fertilisation: two main events are gametogenesis and gamete transfer. Gametogenesis refers to the process of formation of the two types of gametes – male and female. Sexual reproduction in organisms generally involves the fusion of gametes from two different individuals. But this is not always true.
            
            1. Plants may be bisexual (dioecious, papaya & sweet potato) or unisexual (monoecious, coconuts). Unisexual animal species - cockroach. Bisexual/hermaphrodite - earthworms, tapeworm, leech.
            2. Organisms belonging to pteridophytes, gymnosperms, angiosperms and most of the animals including human beings, parental body is diploid (paired chromosomes). Specialized cells called meiocytes (gamete mother cell) undergo meiosis. At the end of meiosis, only one set of chromosomes get incorporated into each gamete. Male and female gametes must be physically brought together to facilitate fusion (fertilisation).
        2. Fertilisation - most vital event of sexual reproduction is perhaps the fusion of gametes. This process is also called syngamy results in the formation of a diploid zygote.
            
            1. some organisms like rotifers, honeybees and even some lizards and birds (turkey), the female gamete undergoes development to form new organisms without fertilisation, phenomenon is called parthenogenesis.
            2. In majority of algae and fishes as well as amphibians, syngamy occurs in the external medium (water)
            3. In organisms exhibiting internal fertilisation, the male gamete is motile and has to reach the egg in order to fuse with it. In seed plants, however, the non-motile male gametes are carried to female gamete by pollen tubes.
        3. Post-fertilisation event - Formation of the diploid zygote is universal in all sexually reproducing organisms. Every sexually reproducing organism, including human beings begin life as a single cell–the zygote.
    6. Embryogenesis refers to the process of development of embryo from the zygote. During embryogenesis, zygote undergoes cell division (mitosis) and cell differentiation. While cell divisions increase the number of cells in the developing embryo; cell differentiation helps groups of cells to undergo certain modifications to form specialized tissues and organs to form an organism.
        
        1. Animals are categorized into oviparous (egg laying) and viviparous (baby) based on whether the development of the zygote takes place outside (ovi) or inside (vivi)
        2. In flowering plants, after fertilisation, ovary develops into fruit and ovules mature into seeds. Inside the mature seed is the progenitor of the next generation, the embryo. ￼
2. Sexual reproduction in flowering plants
    
    1. ![Stigma Anther ](Exported%20image%2020250424103523-5.tiff)
    2. Androecium consists of a whorl of stamens representing the male reproductive organ
        
        1. Parts of a typical stamen – the long and slender stalk called the filament, and the terminal generally bilobed structure called the anther. Anther is a four-sided (tetragonal) structure consisting of four microsporangia. Microsporangia develop further and become pollen sacs.
        2. Inside each microsporangium several thousands of microspores or pollen grains are formed that are released with the maturity of anther
    3. Pollen grains are generally spherical measuring about 25-50 micrometers in diameter. It has a prominent two-layered wall. The hard outer layer called the exine is made up of sporopollenin which is one of the most resistant organic material known. It can withstand high temperatures and strong acids and alkali. Inner wall of the pollen grain is called the intine. It is a thin and continuous layer made up of cellulose and pectin
        
        1. When the pollen grain is mature it contains two cells, the vegetative cell and generative cell. Vegetative cell is bigger, has abundant food reserve and a large irregularly shaped nucleus. Generative cell is small and floats in the cytoplasm of the vegetative cell. Pollen grains of many species cause severe allergies and bronchial afflictions in some people, however their consumption is claimed to increase performance of athletes & race horses
    4. Gynocieum represents the female reproductive part
        
        1. Each pistil has three parts - stigma, style and ovary. The stigma serves as a landing platform for pollen grains. The style is the elongated slender part beneath the stigma. The basal bulged part of the pistil is the ovary.
        2. Arising from the placenta are the megasporangia, commonly called ovules. The number of ovules in an ovary may be one (wheat, paddy, mango) to many (papaya, water melon, orchids). Meiosis results in production of 4 megaspores
            
            1. Female gametophyte - in majority of flowers, 1 of megaspores is functional while others degenerate. Only the functional one develops into female gametophyte.
        3. Both types of gametes in flowers are non-motile, transfer of pollen grains to stigma is called pollination. Kinds of pollination
            
            1. Autogamy - achieved within the same flower.
            2. Geitonogamy - achieved within different flower of same plant
            3. Xenogamy - anther to stigma of different plant
        4. Agents of pollination - water & wind (abiotic), animals (biotic). Biotic is used more, wind common in abiotic. Due to uncertainty of fertilization, enormous amount of pollen is produced vs ovules. Not all aquatic plants use water for pollination. Both wind and water pollinated flowers are not very colorful and do not produce nectar.
            
            1. Bees, butterflies, flies, beetles, wasps, ants, birds and bats are common pollinating agents. Even larger animals such as lemurs have been reported as pollinators. Nectar and pollen grains are floral rewards to sustain animal visits.
            2. Some relationships might exist - moth and plant _yucca_ - in which both species cannot complete life cycles without each other.
            3. Flowering plants have developed many devices to discourage self-pollination and to encourage cross-pollination. (1) pollen release and stigma receptivity are not synchronized (2) anther & stigma at different positions (3) self-incompatibility
            4. Pistil has the ability to recognize the pollen, whether it is of the right type (compatible) or of the wrong type (incompatible).
        5. Artificial hybridization is one of the major approaches of crop improvement programme. In such crossing experiments it is important to make sure that only the desired pollen grains are used for pollination and the stigma is protected from contamination (from unwanted pollen). This is achieved by emasculation and bagging techniques.
            
            1. No need for emasculation if female parent produces unisexual flowers
        6. Angiosperms exhibit double fertilisation because two fusion events occur in each embryo sac, namely syngamy and triple fusion. The products of these fusions are the diploid zygote and the triploid primary endosperm nucleus (in the primary endosperm cell).
            
            1. Zygote develops into the embryo and the primary endosperm cell forms the endosperm tissue. Formation of endosperm always precedes development of the embryo as cells of this tissue are filled with reserve food materials and are used for the nutrition of the developing embryo.
            2. Endosperm may either be completely consumed by the developing embryo (e.g., pea, groundnut, beans) before seed maturation or it may persist in the mature seed (e.g. castor and coconut) and be used up during seed germination
            3. Most zygotes divide only after certain amount of endosperm is formed. This is an adaptation to provide assured nutrition to the developing embryo.
            4. In angiosperms, the seed is the final product of sexual reproduction. It is often described as a fertilized ovule. Seeds are formed inside fruits
            5. Mature seeds may be non-albuminous or ex-albuminous. Non-albuminous seeds have no residual endosperm as it is completely consumed during embryo development (e.g., pea, groundnut). Albuminous seeds retain a part of endosperm as it is not completely used up during embryo development (e.g., wheat, maize, barley, castor).
            6. As ovules mature into seeds, the ovary develops into a fruit, i.e., the transformation of ovules into seeds and ovary into fruit proceeds simultaneously. The wall of the ovary develops into the wall of fruit called pericarp. The fruits may be fleshy as in guava, orange, mango, etc., or may be dry, as in groundnut, and mustard, etc. Most fruits however develop **only** from the ovary and are called true fruits. False fruits are apple, strawberry where thalamus plays a role as well. Banana fruit develops without fertilization, these are called parthenocarpic fruits.
        7. Although seeds, in general are the products of fertilisation, a few flowering plants can produce seeds without fertilisation, called apomixis. Apomicts have several advantages in horticulture and agriculture. Occurrence of more than one embryo in a seed is referred to as polyembryony￼
3. Human reproduction
    
    1. Reproductive events in humans include formation of gametes (gametogenesis), i.e., sperms in males and ovum in females, transfer of sperms into the female genital tract (insemination) and fusion of male and female gametes (fertilisation) leading to formation of zygote.
    2. Scrotum helps in maintaining the low temperature of the testes (2–2.5 C lower than the normal internal body temperature) necessary for spermatogenesis.
    3. Ovaries are the primary female sex organs that produce the female gamete (ovum) and several steroid hormones (ovarian hormones). The uterus is single and it is also called womb. The shape of the uterus is like an inverted pear. It opens into vagina through a narrow cervix.
    4. Functional mammary gland is characteristic of all female mammals. The mammary glands are paired structures (breasts) that contain glandular tissue and variable amount of fat
    5. Primary sex organs – the testis in the males and the ovaries in the females – produce gametes, i.e, sperms and ovum, respectively, by the process called gametogenesis. In testis, the immature male germ cells (spermatogonia) produce sperms by spermatogenesis that begins at puberty. Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46 chromosomes
    6. Structure of a sperm - microscopic structure composed of a head, neck, a middle piece and a tail. Human male ejaculates about 200 to 300 million sperms during a coitus of which, for normal fertility, at least 60 per cent sperms must have normal shape and size and at least 40 per cent of them must show vigorous motility
    7. Process of formation of a mature female gamete is called oogenesis which is markedly different from spermatogenesis. Oogenesis is initiated during the embryonic development stage when a couple of million gamete mother cells (oogonia) are formed within each fetal ovary; no more oogonia are formed and added after birth. At puberty only 60,000-80,000 primary follicles are left in each ovary.

First polar bod} Adult reproductive life ](Exported%20image%2020250424103525-6.tiff)
    9. Menstruation - reproductive cycle in female primates. Begins at puberty called menarche. One ovum is released during the middle of each menstrual cycle (28-29 days). Menstruation occurs only if released ovum is not fertilized. Normal reproductive phase ends with menopause at around 50 years of age.
    10. Fertilisation - motile sperms reach ampullary region of fallopian tube and so does the ovum. Both need to be transported simultaneously here. The sperm induces changes in ovum to ensure only one sperm can fertilize an ovum.
        
        1. Chromosome pattern in human female is XX and male is XY. All haploid gametes produced by female have sex chromosome X where sperms can have either X or Y. Thus, sex of baby is determined by father and not by mother.
    11. Pregnancy - placenta facilitates the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the embryo and also removal of carbon dioxide and excretory/waste materials produced by the embryo, through umbilical cord.
        
        1. Embryo differentiates into an outer layer called ectoderm and an inner layer called endoderm. A mesoderm soon appears between the ectoderm and the endoderm. These three layers give rise to all tissues (organs) in adults.
        2. The process of childbirth is called parturition which is induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism involving cortisol, estrogens and oxytocin. Mammary glands differentiate during pregnancy and secrete milk after child-birth￼
4. Reproductive health
    
    1. India was amongst the first countries in the world to initiate action plans and programmes at a national level to attain total reproductive health as a social goal. These programmes called ‘family planning’ were initiated in 1951
    2. Diaphragms, cervical caps and vaults are also barriers made of rubber that are inserted into the female reproductive tract to cover the cervix during coitus. They prevent conception by blocking the entry of sperms through the cervix. They are reusable
    3. IUDs are one of most widely accepted methods of contraception in India. Pills are very effective with lesser side effects and are well accepted by the females. Saheli –the new oral contraceptive for the females contains a non-steroidal preparation. It is a ‘once a week’ pill with very few side effects and high contraceptive value
    4. Medical termination of pregnancy are considered relatively safe during the first trimester, i.e., upto 12 weeks of pregnancy. Second trimester abortions are much more riskier.
    5. Diseases or infections which are transmitted through sexual intercourse are collectively called sexually transmitted diseases (STD) or venereal diseases (VD) or reproductive tract infections (RTI). Except for hepatitis-B, genital herpes and HIV infections, other diseases are completely curable if detected early and treated properly.
    6. In vitro fertilisation (IVF–fertilisation outside the body in almost similar conditions as that in the body) followed by embryo transfer (ET) is popularly known as test tube baby program. In vivo fertilization, fertilization of a ripe egg within the uterus of a fertile donor female, rather than in an artificial medium, for subsequent nonsurgical transfer to an infertile recipient￼
5. Principle of Inheritance & variation
    
    1. Genetics deals with the inheritance, as well as the variation of characters from parents to offspring. Inheritance is the process by which characters are passed on from parent to progeny; it is the basis of heredity. Variation is the degree by which progeny differ from their parents.
    2. Gregor Mendel, conducted hybridization experiments on garden peas for seven years (1856-1863) and proposed the laws of inheritance in living organisms
        
        1. Genes are the units of inheritance. They contain the information that is required to express a particular trait in an organism. Genes which code for a pair of contrasting traits are known as alleles, i.e., they are slightly different forms of the same gene
    3. Principles or Laws of Inheritance - First Law or Law of Dominance and the Second Law or Law of Segregation.
        
        1. Law of Dominance - (i) Characters are controlled by discrete units called factors (ii) Factors occur in pairs (iii) In a dissimilar pair of factors one member of the pair dominates (dominant) the other (recessive)
        2. Law of Segregation - based on fact that alleles do not show any blending and that both the characters are recovered
    4. Incomplete dominance - Every gene contains the information to express a particular trait. In a diploid organism, there are two copies of each gene, i.e., as a pair of alleles. Now, these two alleles need not always be identical, as in a heterozygote. One of them may be different due to some changes that it has undergone which modifies the information that particular allele contains.
        
        1. Codominance - in which both alleles are simultaneously expressed in the heterozygote.
    5. When Mendel studied the inheritance of two characters together, it was found that the factors independently assort and combine in all permutations and combinations (Law of Independent Assortment). Different combinations of gametes are theoretically represented in a square tabular form known as ‘Punnett Square’
        
        1. Later, it was found that Mendel’s law of independent assortment does not hold true for the genes that were located on the same chromosomes. These genes were called as ‘linked genes’. Closely located genes assorted together, and distantly located genes, due to recombination, assorted independently. Linkage maps, therefore, corresponded to arrangement of genes on a chromosome
    6. Due to the involvement of the X-chromosome in the determination of sex, it was designated to be the sex chromosome, and the rest of the chromosomes were named as autosomes. Out of 23 pairs of chromosomes present, 22 pairs are exactly same in both males and females; these are the autosomes.
        
        1. During spermatogenesis among males, two types of gametes are produced. 50 per cent of the total sperm produced carry the X-chromosome and the rest 50 per cent has Y-chromosome besides the autosomes. Females, however, produce only one type of ovum with an X-chromosome
    7. Mutation - is a phenomenon which results in alteration of DNA sequences and consequently results in changes in the genotype and the phenotype of an organism.
        
        1. In addition to recombination, mutation is another phenomenon that leads to variation in DNA. Since genes are known to be located on chromosomes, alteration in chromosomes results in abnormalities or aberrations. Chromosomal aberrations are commonly observed in cancer cells.
        2. A classical example of such a mutation is sickle cell anemia. Deletions and insertions of base pairs of DNA, causes frame-shift mutations
        3. UV radiations can cause mutations in organisms – it is a mutagen.
    8. Pedigree analysis - an analysis of traits in a several of generations of a family. In the pedigree analysis the inheritance of a particular trait is represented in the family tree over generations
    9. Genetic disorders may be grouped into two categories – Mendelian disorders and Chromosomal disorders. Mendelian disorders are mainly determined by alteration or mutation in the single gene.
        
        1. Most common and prevalent Mendelian disorders are Hemophilia, Cystic fibrosis, Sickle-cell anaemia, Color blindness, Phenylketonuria, Thalassemia, etc
        2. Hemophilia: This sex linked recessive disease, which shows its transmission from **unaffected carrier female to some of the male progeny** has been widely studied. Due to this, in an affected individual a **simple cut will result in non-stop bleeding.** The possibility of a female becoming a **hemophilic is extremely rare** because mother of such a female has to be at least carrier and the father should be hemophilic
        3. Sickle-cell anaemia - is an autosome linked recessive trait that can be transmitted from parents to the offspring when both the partners are carrier for the gene
    10. Chromosomal disorders on the other hand are caused due to absence or excess or abnormal arrangement of one or more chromosomes
        
        1. Down’s syndrome results in the gain of extra copy of chromosome 21. Similarly, Turner’s syndrome results due to loss of an X chromosome in human females.
        2. Total number of chromosomes in a normal human cell is 46 (23 pairs). Out of these 22 pairs are autosomes and one pair of chromosomes are sex chromosome. Sometimes, though rarely, either an additional copy of a chromosome may be included in an individual or an individual may lack one of any one pair of chromosomes. These situations are known as trisomy or monosomy of a chromosome, respectively. Down’s syndrome, Turner’s syndrome, Klinefelter’s syndrome are common examples of chromosomal disorders
        3. Down’s Syndrome - cause of this genetic disorder is the presence of an additional copy of the chromosome number 21 (trisomy of 21)
        4. Klinefelter’s Syndrome - genetic disorder is also caused due to the presence of an additional copy of X-chromosome resulting into a karyotype of 47, XXY. Such an individual has overall masculine development, with some feminine development
        5. Turner’s Syndrome - caused due to the absence of one of the X chromosomes, i.e., 45 with X0, Such females are sterile as ovaries are rudimentary besides other features including lack of other secondary sexual characters￼
6. Molecular basis of inheritance
    
    1. Nucleic acids are long polymers of nucleotides. While DNA stores genetic information, RNA mostly helps in transfer and expression of information. Though DNA and RNA both function as genetic material, but DNA being chemically and structurally more stable is a better genetic material. However, RNA is the first to evolve and DNA was derived from RNA.
    2. The hallmark of the double stranded helical structure of DNA is the hydrogen bonding between the bases from opposite strands. A segment of DNA that codes for RNA may in a simplistic term can be referred as gene.
    3. Transcription is the first step in gene expression. It involves copying a gene's DNA sequence to make an RNA molecule. During transcription also, one of the strands of DNA acts a template to direct the synthesis of complementary RNA
    4. Translation is the process of translating the sequence of a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule to a sequence of amino acids during protein synthesis. Translation is a process that has evolved around RNA, indicating that life began around RNA. Since, transcription and translation are energetically very expensive processes, these have to be tightly regulated. In bacteria, more than one gene is arranged together and regulated in units called as operons
    5. Human genome project was a mega project that aimed to sequence every base in human genome. This project has yielded much new information. Many new areas and avenues have opened up as a consequence of the project. DNA Fingerprinting is a technique to find out variations in individuals of a population at DNA level. It works on the principle of polymorphism in DNA sequences. It has immense applications in the field of forensic science, genetic biodiversity and evolutionary biology￼
7. Evolution
    
    1. Evolutionary Biology is the study of history of life forms on earth.
        
        1. Big Bang theory attempts to explain to us the origin of universe. It talks of a singular huge explosion unimaginable in physical terms. The universe expanded and hence, the temperature came down. Hydrogen and Helium formed sometime later. The gases condensed under gravitation and formed the galaxies of the present day universe.
        2. In the solar system of the milky way galaxy, earth was supposed to have been formed about 4.5 billion years back. There was no atmosphere on early earth. Water vapor, methane, carbon dioxide and ammonia released from molten mass covered the surface. The UV rays from the sun broke up water vapor into hydrogen and oxygen and the lighter H2 escaped. Oxygen combined with ammonia and methane to form water, CO2 and others. The ozone layer was formed. As it cooled, the water vapor fell as rain, to fill all the depressions and form oceans. Life appeared 500 million years after the formation of earth
    2. For a long time it was also believed that life came out of decaying and rotting matter like straw, mud, etc. This was the theory of spontaneous generation (which was dismissed soon).
        
        1. First form of life could have come from pre-existing non-living organic molecules (e.g. RNA, protein, etc.) and that formation of life was preceded by chemical evolution, i.e., formation of diverse organic molecules from inorganic constituents.
        2. This version of a biogenesis, i.e., the first form of life arose slowly through evolutionary forces from non-living molecules is accepted by majority.
    3. The novelty and brilliant insight of Darwin was this: he asserted that variations, which are heritable and which make resource utilization better for few (adapted to habitat better) will enable only those to reproduce and leave more progeny.
    4. The fitness, according to Darwin, refers ultimately and only to reproductive fitness. Hence, those who are better fit in an environment, leave more progeny than others. These, therefore, will survive more and hence are selected by nature. He called it **natural selection and implied it as a mechanism of evolution**
    5. Adaptive radiation - process of evolution of different species in a given geographical area starting from a point and literally radiating to other areas of geography (habitats). E.g. marsupials in Australia.
    6. Hardy-Weinberg principle says that allele frequencies in a population are stable and is constant from generation to generation. The gene pool (total genes and their alleles in a population) remains a constant. This is called genetic equilibrium.
        
        1. Five factors are known to affect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These are gene migration or gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, genetic recombination and natural selection
    7. First human-like being the hominid was called Homo habilis. Probably didn't eat meat.
