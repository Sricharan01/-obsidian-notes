1. Industrial Revolution
    
    1. Introduction
        
        1. After middle ages, **feudalism as an economic system was declining**, furthered by Renaissance and Enlightenment. **Growth in trade** led to rise of cities and towns which further led t**o production of manufactured goods.**
        2. Increase in demand for goods which were previously considered luxurious (such as cotton clothes), with a rise in standard of living. All these factors stimulated production of manufactured goods, as traditional methods were inadequate to meet growing demands.
        3. From mid-18th century onwards, began a series of changes which revolutionized techniques and organization of production. Resulted in a new type of economy - industrial economy.
    2. Capitalism & colonization
        
        1. New system of society which was emerging in Europe from 15th century. Under which instruments and means by which goods are produced are owned by private individuals and production is carried out for making profits. Workers do not own anything but work for a wage. Owners of wealth are capitalists invest it to make a profit.

            ==Feudalism== ==Capitalism==
            ==Economic life under feudalism was static as goods were produced for local consumption and there was no incentive to produce more by employing better means of producing goods for a bigger market.== ==Economy life under capitalism was fast moving with the aim of producing more and more goods for bigger markets so that more profits could be made.==
            
        3. Discovery of **new lands and establishment of colonies** resulted in unprecedented expansion o**f trade and accumulation of wealth** by merchants. Colonization was accompanied by the **plunder of the wealth** of the people who were colonized.
            
            1. Treasures of the **Inca and Aztec** were plundered by the Spaniards.
            2. Mines of conquered areas were **exploited for natural resources** such as gold and silver (South America and Africa)
            3. **Slave labor in plantations** in Americas and East Asia.
            4. Karl Marx said - treasures captured outside Europe by undisguised looting, enslavement, and murder, floated back to the mother country and were turned into capital.
    3. Industrial Revolution
        
        1. Desire to produce **more goods at low cost to make higher profits** led to Industrial Revolution and **further growth of capitalism.** Industrial revolution began around 1750 when machines started to take over some of the work done by people and animals in productions of goods and commodities and was beginning of machine age.
        2. After 1750, new inventions **came much faster than ever before** that brought rapid changes in people's lives. Industrial revolution changed men's way of living and thinking all over the world.
        3. Guild system had given way to **domestic or putting out system before factories** - In putting-out, work is contracted by a central agent to subcontractors who complete the work in off-site facilities, either in their own homes or in workshops with multiple craftsmen.
    4. Factory system
        
        1. In place of simple tools and the use of animal and manual power, **new machines and steam power** came to be increasingly used. Many new cities sprang up and artisans and dispossessed peasants went there to work.
        2. Everything required for production was provided by the capitalists for the workers who were brought **together under one roof.** Everything belonged to the owner of the factory, including the finished product, and workers worked for wages.
    5. Why Industrial Revolution in England?
        
        1. **Vast profits** - through overseas trade, including slave trade, profits necessary for capital.
        2. Emerged as **unrivalled power in trade rivalries** abroad hence could ensure regular supply of raw materials
        3. **No shortage of labor** - after disappearance of serfdom and enclosure movement, holdings were consolidated and large army of landless unemployed people was created.
        4. **Stable govt** - no longer under the domination of feudal classes and commercial class acquired more political power
        5. **Natural resources** - England had plenty of natural resources such as iron and coal, essential for industries.
        6. **Transportation** - England had large shipping industry and had no problems of transportation
    
    No other country **enjoyed all these advantages at this period.** Some suffered from a lack of capital or natural resources and some from an **unfavorable political system**. Many of them, such as Italy and Germany, were not even united and suffered from many economic restrictions.
    
    7. Textile Industry
        
        1. In the 1700s, **English East India Company was sending cotton** from India to England. Soon, calico cloth made in Calicut and Dacca muslin and Kashmir shawls were in great demand. Soon businessmen began to **import cotton and make it into cloth in England.** When the workers using old-fashioned spinning-wheels and handlooms could not keep up with the increasing demand, a **series of inventions came along to make faster spinning** and weaving possible.
        2. In 1764, **Hargreaves invented Spinning jenny** which speeded up spinning. Arkwright adapted this machine for running with water. **Crompton**, sometime later, combined the advantages of the machines invented by Hargreaves and Arkwright. These three inventions alone made it possible for England to produce thread that was **finer and cheaper** than any that could be produced by others or with older techniques. In 1785, **Cartwright invented a power loom**. This machine could be run by horses or bullocks and later, when factories were set up along rivers and canals, water power was used to operate it.
        
        Steam engine by **James Watt in 1769 revolutionized production** as men or animals couldn't compete with power of steam engine.
        
        4. **Blast furnace** - with steam power, there was a demand for more machinery. Development of blast furnace and later method of turning **low grade iron into steel enabled industries** to produce steel cheaply. Now they could make better and more machines.
    8. Transport and communications revolution
        
        1. **Railways** - In 1814, **George Stephenson** developed steam engine to haul coal from mines to ports by railways.
            
            1. In 1830, the **first railway train began to carry passengers** and freight from Liverpool to Manchester.
            2. These events were followed by a **great wave of railroad construction** in England and the United States. In 1853 under Lord Dalhousie, the first railroad was laid in India.
        2. **Roads** - Need to transport raw materials and manufactured products led to the improvement of roads and the digging of canals— in England and other countries. McAdams devised the method of making pakka or **‘macadamized’ roads.**
        3. **Canal** - building these spread to Europe and America and was a big help in providing cheaper transportation, especially after steam boats came into use.
        4. **Posts** - improved transportation helped in carrying messages, people and goods. Penny post - began to operate in England in early 19th century. Business concerns took advantage of the penny-post in their buying and selling transactions far and near.
    9. Agricultural revolution
        
        1. **Farm mechanization** - changes in farm methods to produce **more food, cash crops and raw materials** for industries. New farm machinery such as steel plough and harrow for breaking ground, mechanical drill for seeding and horse-drawn cultivator.
        2. **Crop rotation** - intensive manuring and practice of crop rotation to maintain soil fertility (a departure from middle ages when 3rd year land was left fallow).
        3. **Land consolidation** -big land-holders took over the **common meadow** in a village also leaving the small land-owners and tenants with no pasture. But the big land-owners controlled Parliament in those days and got **laws passed that enabled them to do these things.** This and enclosure movement meant peasants were forced off land.
    10. Beginning of Pax Britannica
        
        1. In a little more than **50 years after the use of machines** began, England had become the **world’s leading industrial nation.**
            
            1. In first half of 19th century, textile exports to India jumped from **50,000 kg to well over 2.5 million kg.**
            2. Amount of coal mined rose from **15 to 64 million tons** and became an important export.
            3. Production of pig iron increased from **690,000 tons to over 3 million**— enough to supply all the machinery and hardware needed at home, besides sending vast quantities to other countries.
        2. **Tariffs** - As England was 1st country where industries developed, **gained complete control over world markets.** Even with machines, countries couldn't compete with scale of English industries. **Levy of tariffs to protect new industries** became a wide spread practice (colonies couldn't do that **hence local economy was destroyed**)
    11. Elsewhere in world
        
        1. Germany - by 1865, occupied **second place as a producer of steel,** but with England far ahead in the lead. After a late start, Germany’s industrial development took an **amazing leap after 1870** when the German states were finally welded into one nation. Soon Germany was to become England’s rival.
        2. United States had introduced **machines and started factories before 1800—** after gaining independence from England. By 1860, had well **established textile, steel, and shoe industries**. The American industries grew very rapidly after 1870.
        3. Japan was the **first country in Asia** to industrialize. Traditionally, Japan produced mainly such articles as **silk, porcelain and toys.** By the end of the 19th century, Japanese production included **steel, machinery, metal goods and chemicals**— and in quantities large enough for export.
    12. Race for raw materials
        
        1. Search for **markets and sources of raw materials** resulted in international rivalries. First England later, other Western countries began to **look for new sources of raw materials and markets** for their manufactures.
        2. Towards the end of th**e 19th century Japan was industrialized and joined the race**. In this race, almost the **entire non-industrialized world** was carved up into colonies— spheres of influence or territories— for economic and political domination by industrialized countries.
        3. Thus arose imperialism, under which **strong nations subordinated the economies of the countries** under their domination to their own interests. They forced them to buy and sell on their own terms.
    13. Urbanization and industrial revolution
        
        1. Earlier, most population lived in **villages and was connected to land.** All economic needs of people were met within the village itself. Cities were **center of craft and political** control.
        2. With industries, new **cities and towns that grew were important** more as centers of industry than as political and administrative centers.
        3. Large part of the population **now started living in cities** where thousands of people worked in industrial establishments. This population was not connected with land. Now in some industrialized countries, less than 20% of the population is connected with land.
        4. Crowding of people into cities has **always produced problems of housing, health, and sanitation.** The quickening pace of industrialization in England created **deplorable living conditions**, concentration in smoky industrial towns, and city slums grew worse.
        5. Social bonds were **dissolved and man became freer** to develop capabilities, for better or worse.
        6. Industrial Revolution created an **international consciousness** among peoples because the developments in **one place began to influence** the developments in other places.
    14. Industrial Capitalism
        
        1. Resulted in **concentration of economic power in few hands** who came to control the lives of not only a large number of workers whom they employed but also, directly or indirectly, the **economic life of the entire society.**
        2. Resulted in shocking **social inequalities and created a wide gulf** between capitalists and the rest of the population.
        3. Workers had to **accept whatever wage was offered to them** because usually there were more people than jobs. Women and children were hired in mines because they could be hired for less wages.
    15. Condition of workers
        
        1. Housing - provided for **workers were no better.** Whole areas of the industrial cities where workers lived were **crowded slums.** Accidents, disease and epidemics were common.
        2. **No social security -** workers could be dismissed at the pleasure of employer, fired during slack period.
    16. Labor laws & trade union
        
        1. **Humanitarian reformers and some land-owners** who were jealous of big businessmen combined with English workers to get the first laws to improve conditions of work
        2. In **1802, first Factory Act passed,** limiting hours of children's work to 12/day. In **1819, forbade employment of children under 9.**
        3. By 1824, workers succeeded in getting **laws against unions repealed** leading to remarkable growth in unions. In 1830s and 40s movement to get **right of vote to workers** known as **Chartist Movement** was launched.
        4. The many benefits that **workers and all salaried people enjoy** in most industrialized countries today are due directly or indirectly to the **efforts to correct the terrible conditions that the Industrial Revolution** brought about.
    17. Laissez-faire and capitalism
        
        1. When Industrial Revolution was gaining strength in England— and in other countries— the growing belief was that **governments should not interfere** with business and industry. Laissez-faire or **‘leave us alone’,** was then a kind of religion among capitalists.
        2. According to the laissez faire idea, the businessman should be **free to look after his own interests.** Only the unwritten law of supply and demand should determine the size of his profits. The same **unwritten law would determine the fate of the worker**, whether he had a job, what would be his working conditions and salary. Adam Smith voiced this idea in 1776 in a book called **The Wealth of Nations**, and it had many supporters, too.
    18. Socialism
        
        1. Greatest challenge to laissez faire, and to capitalism itself, has come from the **idea of socialism,** which grew in the beginning as a reaction against the evils of capitalism.
        2. However, they came to believe that, for **basic improvement in their life,** socialism or a **complete re-ordering of society** was essential.
        3. Industrialization and capitalism brought **benefits as well as hardships and evils to man**— unemployment, smoky, crowded cities, unhealthy living and working conditions, rivalry and conflict between nations.
        4. As working men got the right to vote and elect their representatives in government, they forced the **passage of laws that eliminated many of the early evils** that industrialization had brought about. Ideas of socialism also arose which, while recognizing the importance of machines and making them even better, aimed at **solving the problems created by capitalism**, by building a new social order.￼
2. World in 18th century & American Revolution
    
    1. Feudalism to nation-states
        
        1. Under feudalism, societies were **divided into classes** some of which were privileged while the others were exploited. A man’s entire life was **determined at the time of his birth,** depending on the class into which he was born. 2 main classes were feudal **lords and serfs.** Kings claimed divine rights, that their power was derived from God.
        2. Boundaries of states also were irrational. There were all kinds of states—**empires, feudal estates, city-states.** Territories within a state were not necessarily contiguous. Territories inhabited by homogenous people were divided into number of states - **under local ruler, Church or an Empire.**
        3. Middle class played a **great role in bringing about Renaissance and acquired economic power** through trade and commerce. However, they were now obstructed in their **growth by outdated political system** based on privilege.
        4. With Industrial revolution, **strength of this class and a new class, that of industrial workers, grew**. Both were opposed to autocratic political systems. Serfdom had declined in some countries but in most other countries of Europe, it was still the **dominant feature of the social system.** There were many revolts of the serfs but they were suppressed**. 1st successful revolution** which overthrew the autocratic monarchy took place in England in the **17th century.**
        5. Also rise of **national consciousness and movements** to unite different territories, if were divided as different states or ruled by imperial powers.
    2. Renaissance had inaugurated an **era of questioning established beliefs and was a cultural movement.** Great progress was made in various sciences, which also **undermined the existing beliefs.** New ideas were characterized by **rationalism** and were increasingly concerned with secular affairs.
        
        1. Because of the growing emphasis on reason, the period of the 18th century in European history is called the **Age of Enlightenment.**
        2. Beliefs that allowed people to be categorized into higher or lower groups on the **basis of birth and hold of Church in sphere of ideas** were undermined.
        3. New ideas were ideas of **liberty, equality and fraternity.** Thus arose ideas of freedom, democracy and equality, which became the rallying slogans of peoples everywhere.
        4. Simultaneously, also arose **ideas of nationalism** which brought a sense of unity and oneness to the people forming a nation and the **desire to organize themselves** into independent states with their distinctive national identities.
    3. Revolution - is a **drastic or radical change.** It can be sudden **overthrow of established authority** or system by force or gradual change through peaceful means.
        
        1. Revolution involve**s fundamental change** in entire political system, nature of govt and aims of govt, and class that holds power.
        2. Revolutions have played a**n essential role in the development of human societies.** Without them, one kind of system, however unsuitable for the times it might be, would **continue for ever and there would be no progress.**
    4. American Revolution - the English colonies
        
        1. While some Englishmen were battling at home for **improvements in Parliament and reforms in religion**, others were adventuring across the Atlantic to establish colonies and trade in the Americas.
        2. In 16th century, European countries began to make settlements there. In North America, **colonies were established by France, Holland and Spain** as well as by England. In 18th century, England drove France out of the eastern part of the continent and Canada.
        3. By mid-18th century there were **13 English colonies** in North America along the Atlantic Coast. **Landless peasants, people seeking religious freedom, traders, and profiteers** had settled there with bulk of the population consisted of **independent farmers.** Infant industries had developed in such products as wool, flax, and leather.
        4. In north there were **fishing and ship-building** and in the south, **large plantations** like feudal manors had grown up where tobacco and cotton were grown with slave labor brought from Africa.
        5. Each colony had a **local assembly elected by qualified voters.** These assemblies enacted laws concerning local matters, and levied taxes. However, they were under the rule of the mother country.
    5. Causes of revolution
        
        1. Colonial policy of England in **economic matters was the primary cause of resentment** in the American colonies. England’s policies did not encourage the American colonies to **develop an economy of their own.**
        2. Trade - English Parliament had **forbidden them to use non-British ships** in their trade. Tobacco, cotton, sugar could **only be exported to England.** Heavy **duties** on import of goods from other places. Colonies also forbidden to **start iron or textile industries.**
        3. Land - English also angered the colonists by issuing a proclamation to **prevent them from moving west** into new lands. English aristocrats had bought lands in America and **got rents from the farmers.** They wanted to keep the colonists as renters.
        4. Taxes - As a result of continuous wars in Europe, **govt was burdened with debt**. In 1765, the English Parliament passed the **Stamp Act which imposed stamp taxes** on all business transactions in the American colonies. Aroused violent resentment among all sections of the colonists and **led them to boycott English goods. T**here were uprisings in many towns and tax-collectors were killed.
        5. Colonists claimed that, since **English Parliament had no representatives from the colonies,** it had no right to levy taxes on them. The revenue from these taxes was used **not in the interests of the colonies** but of English.
        6. Ideas - American revolutionaries were inspired by the ideas of the English philosophers of the 17th century. These philosophers— **Locke, Harrington, Milton**—believed that men had **certain fundamental rights** which no government had the right to infringe. **Jefferson and Paine** (in _Common Sense_) were other vocal leaders for the cause of independence.
    6. Events leading up to war
        
        1. Leaders called a meeting at Massachusetts and proclaimed "**No taxation without representation"**. Threatened to **stop import of British goods**, which led to repeal of Stamp Act. However new taxes on consumer goods were imposed, such as **glass, tea, paint, paper**. Once again Americans protested and cut down imports from Britain to half. English withdrew the taxes - **except on tea - as its symbolic power** posturing.
        2. Tax on tea led to trouble. In 1773, several colonies **refused to unload the tea coming in English ships**. The governor ordered a ship to be unloaded, group of citizens dressed as **American Indians dumped the crates** into sea. Incident is known as **Boston Tea Party.** English government then closed the port of Boston to all trade and precipitated the **uprising of the colonies.**
        3. Representatives of the 13 American colonies met as a group in what is called the **First Continental-Congress at Philadelphia** in 1774. This Congress appealed to the English King to **remove restrictions on industries and trade** and not to impose any taxes without their consent. King declared their **action a mutiny and ordered troops** to be sent to suppress it. The colonies then planned for **military defense with local troops or militia.**
        4. Declaration On 4 July 1776, the **Second Continental Congress** asserted _‘_**that all men are created equal"**_,_ Congress adopted the Declaration of that **"they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these rights are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"**_._  Till this time the colonists had been fighting for their rights as Englishmen. After the Declaration in 1776, they fought for their right to be an independent nation.
    7. War of Independence
        
        1. **George Washington** was in command of **American forces.** First battles took in and around Boston. Initial victory of **American colonial militia** against trained British army gave Americans confidence.
        2. French government also decided to help the **colonies with troops, supplies and funds**—to embarrass the English, France's old enemy. Other enemies of English—Spain and Holland—were soon **fighting the English elsewhere**
        3. Some leaders in Parliament were also against war with colonists and there troubles brewing at home in Ireland. War ended in 1781 when the English commander, **Cornwallis**, later to become governor-general in India, surrendered. **In 1783, Treaty of Paris was signed** and the English recognized the independence of its 13 former colonies.
    8. American Constitution
        
        1. When the war of independence started, each of the 13 colonies was a **separate state** with its own army, boundaries, customs duties and finances. But they **co-operated** against a common enemy. A constitutional convention was called in Philadelphia to frame a new constitution, **which came into effect in 1789.**
        2. American constitution established a **republican form of government** at a time when states in other parts of the world were governed by monarchies.
        3. **Jefferson and followers c**ampaigned for **Bill of Rights to be added to Constitution,** which was done by 10 amendments. It was the **first written republican constitution** ever framed in history, which is still in operation.
    9. Significance -
        
        1. Words of the Declaration of Independence regarding the **equality of all men and the ‘inalienable rights’** of man electrified the atmosphere in America and outside. **Lafayette**, French general who fought for Americans, was soon to become a hero of the French Revolution. **Thomas Paine** also participated in the French Revolution.
        2. Inspired many revolutionaries in Europe later in the 19th century. It encouraged Spanish and Portuguese colonies in Central and South America **to rebel and gain their independence.**
        3. Main achievement of the American Revolution was the **establishment of a republic.** This republic was, however, **not truly democratic.** The right to vote was limited. Negroes— most of them still slaves—American Indians, and women had no vote.
    10. Growth of a nation - USA added **Florida (Spain), Louisiana (France)** and won territories from Mexico and expanded till Pacific coast. Increased settlement in west brought **slave owning Southern states (Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee) and industrial capitalists** Northern states (Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses Grant) in conflict. Led to Civil War bw 1861-1865 and defeat of southern states and abolition of slavery.
        
        1. Causes
            
            1. Southern leaders said that the **Republican policy of blocking the expansion of slavery into the West** made them second-class citizens, and they also said it challenged their autonomy
            2. **Sectionalism** resulted from the **different economies, social structure, customs and political values** of the North and South
            3. Slave owners preferred low-cost manual labor with no mechanization. Northern manufacturing interests **supported tariffs and protectionism** while **southern planters demanded free trade**
            4. **Perceived insults** to Southern collective honor included the enormous popularity of **Uncle Tom's Cabin** (1852) and the actions of **abolitionist John Brown** in trying to incite a slave rebellion in 1859
            5. Election of **Abraham Lincoln in 1860** was the final trigger for secession, feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. 
        2. **Reconstruction Era** (1863–1877) overlapped and **followed the war,** with the process of restoring national unity, strengthening the national government, and granting civil rights to freed black slaves throughout the country.￼
3. French Revolution
    
    1. It was brewing when **American War of Independence** was being fought. French Revolution was **more world shaking** than the American one. It became a widespread upheaval over which **no one could remain neutral.**
        
        1. Conditions in France were no worse than conditions in other parts of Europe: Autocratic and extravagant rulers, privileged nobles and clergy, landless peasants and jobless workers, unequal taxation - these were some of the common hardships endured by people.
        2. France was a **strong and powerful state** in the 18th century, and had **seized vast territories** in North America, islands in the West Indies.
    2. First and Second Estate
        
        1. |
            |
            ==Privileged class== ==Also known as== ==Population==
            ==Clergy== ==First estate== ==1.3 lakh clerics==
            ==Nobility== ==Second estate== ==80 thousand families==
            
        
        These classes were **exempted from all taxes**, controlled most of the administrative posts and all the high-ranking posts in the army. Also together **owned about 40% of the total land** of France. Their incomes came primarily from their large land-holdings.
        
        3. Minority of these also **depended on pensions and gifts from the king**. They considered it beneath their dignity to trade or to be engaged in manufacture or to do any work. Life of the nobility was everywhere characterized by **extravagance and luxury.** There were some poorer sections in these two top estates. They were discontented and blamed the richer members of their class for their misery.
    3. Third Estate - rest of the people of France. Numbered about **95% of the total population** and were the unprivileged people.
        
        1. Largest section consisted of peasants, **almost 80% of total population**. Most of the peasants were **free**, unlike the serfs in the Middle Ages. Great majority of the French **peasants were landless or had very small holdings.**
        2. Plight of tenants and share croppers was worse. After rents, could only **save 1/3 or 1/4 of what he produced**. Certain changes in agriculture in 18th century France worsened conditions of peasant. Could no longer take **wood from forests or use uncultivated land for grazing**. Forced labor for public works by feudal lord was common practice. Taxes for local roads, bridges and churches were inevitable. A bad harvest in such circumstances led to starvation and unrest.
        3. Middle class or **bourgeoisie consisted of the educated people**— writers, doctors, judges, lawyers, teachers, civil servants— and the richer people who were merchants, bankers, and manufacturers. This class was forerunner of the builders of the industries which were to **transform economic and social life** in the 19th century.
        4. Since these people had money, the state, the clergy and the nobility **were indebted to them.** However, the middle class had **no political rights**. It had no social status, and its members had to suffer many humiliations.
        5. Condition of the city poor—workers and artisans—was **inhuman** in the 18th-century France. They were looked upon as **inferior creatures without any rights**. No worker could leave his job for another without the employer’s consent and a certificate of good conduct. This group was to become the mainstay of the French Revolution.
    4. Monarchy - at the head of the French state stood the king, an **absolute monarch**. Louis XVI was the king of France when the revolution broke out.
        
        1. He was a man of **mediocre intelligence**, obstinate and indifferent to the work of the government. His wife, **Marie Antoinette,** squandered money on festivities and **interfered in state appointments** in order to promote her favorites. 
        2. The state was always faced by financial troubles as one would expect. Keeping **huge armies and waging wars** made matters worse. Finally, it brought the state to bankruptcy.
    5. Intellectual movement -
        
        1. Discontent or even wretchedness is not enough to make a successful revolution. Someone **must help the discontented** to focus on an ‘enemy’ and provide **ideals** to fight for.
        2. **Revolutionary thinking and ideas** must precede revolutionary action. France in the 18th century had **many revolutionary thinkers**. Without the ideas spread by these philosophers, the French Revolution would simply have been an outbreak of violence.
        3. **Rationalism** - because of the ideas expressed by the French intellectuals, the 18th century has been called the **Age of Reason.** Christianity had taught that man was born to suffer. However, philosophers argued that man was **born to be happy.** They believed that man can attain happiness if reason is **allowed to destroy prejudice and reform man’s institutions.** They urged faith in reason. The power of reason alone, they said, was sufficient to build a perfect society.
        4. Attack on clergy - clergy were the first to feel the brunt of the French philosophers. Scientific advances dating from the Renaissance helped in their campaign against the clergy. **Voltaire**, one of the most famous French writers of the time, though not an atheist, believed **all religions absurd and contrary to reason.** Voltaire, other philosophers, atheists and materialists, gained popularity. They believed that man’s **destiny lay in this world** rather than in heaven.
        5. Theory of laissez-faire had gained currency in French economists (known as physiocrats). Taxes should be imposed **only with the consent** of those on whom they were levied. These ideas were a **direct denial of the privileges and feudal rights** that protected the upper classes.
        6. Democracy - philosopher-writer, **Montesquieu**, thought about the kind of government that is best suited to man and outlined the **principles of constitutional monarchy**. Jean Jacques **Rousseau** who asserted the **doctrine of popular sovereignty** and democracy. He said, _‘Man is born free, yet everywhere he is in chains.’_ He talked of the **‘state of nature’ when man was free,** and said that freedom was lost following the emergence of property. What was needed, said Rousseau, was a **new ‘social contract’** to guarantee the freedom, equality and happiness which man had enjoyed in the state of nature.
    6. Outbreak of revolution
        
        1. In 1789, Louis XVI’s **need for money compelled** him to agree to a meeting of the Estates General— the old feudal assembly. Louis wanted to obtain its **consent for new loans and taxes**. All three Estates were represented in it but each one held a separate meeting.
        2. On 17 June 1789, members of the Third Estate, claiming to represent 95% of the nation’s population, **declared themselves the National Assembly.** On 20 June, they found their meeting-hall occupied by royal guards but, determined to meet, they moved to the nearby **royal tennis court** to work out a constitution, known as **Tennis Court Oath.**
        3. Louis then made preparations to break up the Assembly. Troops were called: rumors spread that leading members of the Assembly would soon be arrested. This **enraged the people, who began to gather** in their thousands. They were soon joined by the guards. They surrounded the Bastille, a state prison.
        4. On 14 July, they broke open the doors and freed all the prisoners. **Fall of Bastille** **symbolized the fall of autocracy.**
    7. After Fall of Bastille
        
        1. After 14 July 1789, Louis XVI was king only in name. The National Assembly began to **enact laws.** Revolt spread to other towns and cities and into countryside. National Assembly adopted the **famous** **Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen.** It specified the **equality of all men** before the law, eligibility of all citizens for all public offices, freedom from arrest or punishment without proven cause, freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
        2. Most importantly, to the middle class, it required equitable distribution of the **burdens of taxation and rights of private property**. This was quite revolutionary as every govt in Europe was **based on privilege**. If these ideas were applied, the entire old order of Europe would be destroyed
    8. War and Republic of France
        
        1. People were soon involved in a **war to defend the Revolution** and the nation. Many nobles and clerics fled the country and encouraged other European autocrats to **intervene in France against the Revolution.** The king and queen tried to escape from France in disguise but they were recognized and brought back as captives and traitors.
        2. Old National Assembly was replaced by a **Legislative Assembly.** This Assembly took over the property of those people who had fled. It sent word to the Austrian emperor, who was mobilizing support against France to **renounce every treaty directed against the French nation.** When the emperor refused, the Legislative Assembly declared war.
        3. France had destroyed **feudalism and monarchy and founded new institutions** based on liberty and equality, whereas in these countries the old way of life remained. The commander-in-chief of the Austro-Prussian forces stated that the aim was to **suppress anarchy in France and to restore the king’s authority.** The French revolutionaries replied by offering **‘fraternity and assistance’ to all people** wishing to destroy the old order in their countries.
        4. Then, a radical group, the **Jacobins****, believing in direct democracy,** came to power. Fearing that the Revolution was in danger, this group took to strong measures to **crush forces inimical** to the Revolution. In 14 months, some 17,000 people, including those who were innocent, were tried and executed. This period was called **“Reign of Terror“.**
        5. Later, a new constitution was drawn up. But the **army became increasingly powerful and this led to the rise of Napoleon,** who was soon to declare himself Emperor of the French Republic.
    9. Napoleonic Wars
        
        1. From **1792 to 1815, France was engaged in war** almost continuously. It was a war between France and other states. Some have termed it as an **international civil war** because it was fought between revolutionary France and countries upholding the old order. **In this war, France was alone.** Until Napoleon became emperor, almost every enlightened person in the world sympathized with the French Revolution.
        2. Between **1793 and 1796 French armies conquered** almost all of western Europe. After Napoleon became emperor, France recovered the territories she **had lost and defeated** Austria in 1805, Prussia in 1806, and Russia in 1807. On the sea the French could not score against the stronger British navy.
        3. Finally, an **alliance of almost all Europe defeated France** at Leipzig in 1813. These allied forces later occupied Paris, and Napoleon was defeated. His attempt at recovery was **foiled at the battle of Waterloo** in June 1815. The peace settlement, which involved all Europe, took place at the Congress of Vienna. **Bourbon dynasty was reinstalled** as the ruler.
        4. However, within a few years, in 1830, there was another outbreak of revolution. In 1848, the **monarchy was again overthrown** though it soon reappeared. Finally, in **1871, the Republic was again proclaimed** (Third Republic till 1940).
        5. Napoleon - ideas that **underpin our modern world**—meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on—were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically **extended by Napoleon**. To them he added a rational and **efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry**, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the **greatest codification of laws** since the fall of the Roman Empire.
    10. Consequences of Revolution
        
        1. **Destruction of feudalism** - All the laws of the old feudal regime were annulled. Church lands and lands held in common by the community were bought by the middle classes. The lands of nobles were confiscated. Privileged classes were abolished.
        2. **Napoleon code in Europe** - Many elements of this Code remained in force for a long time; some of them exist even to this day.
        3. The **term ‘nation’ got its modern meaning**. A nation is not the territory that the people belonging to it inhabit **but the people themselves.** France was not merely the territories known as France but the ‘French people’.
        4. **Idea of sovereignty** - a nation recognizes **no law or authority above its own**. People constituting the nation are the source of all power and authority. There cannot be any rulers above the people, only a republic in which the government derives its authority from the people and is answerable to the people
        5. **Military of the sovereign** - entire nation was united behind the army which consisted of revolutionary citizens. In a war in which almost all of Europe was ranged against France, they would have had no chance with just a mercenary army.
        6. Under the Jacobin constitution, all people were given the **right to vote and the right of insurrection.** Government must provide the people with work or livelihood and aim of happiness of all was proclaimed. Though it was never really put into effect, it was the first genuinely democratic constitution in history
    11. Impact of revolution
        
        1. Inspired revolutionary movements in **almost every country** of Europe and in South and Central America.
        2. Old ruling dynasty of France had been restored to power in 1815, and the autocratic governments of Europe found themselves safe for the time being, the rulers found it **increasingly difficult to rule the people**.
        3. French soldiers, wherever they went, carried with them **ideas of liberty and equality** shaking the old feudal order. They destroyed serfdom in areas which came under their occupation and modernized the systems of administration
        4. **Political and social systems** of the 18th century had received a heavy blow. They were soon to die in most of Europe under the impact of the revolutionary movements that sprang up everywhere in Europe.
        5. Revolutionary France had **abolished slavery** in her colonies. The former French colony of **Haiti became a republic.** This was the **first republic established by the black people**, formerly slaves, in the Americas.
        6. During early 19th century, these two imperialist countries - **Spain and Portugal - were cut off from their colonies,** with the result that most of the Portuguese and Spanish colonies in Central and South America became independent.￼
4. Nationalism in Europe
    
    1. Nationalism emerged as a **major force in this period**. However, it was neither exclusive nor chauvinistic. Inspired by the **aim of fighting against despotism** everywhere.
        
        1.  South American revolutionaries **O’Higgins, Simon Bolivar and San Martin** fought for the independence of many countries in South America.
        2. **Mazzini**, one of the foremost leaders of the struggle for Italian unification and independence, formed a number of organizations such as Young Poland, Young Germany and **Young Italy** for the liberation of these countries.
        3. Giuseppe **Garibaldi**, another great leader of the Italian revolutionaries, fought for the freedom of the peoples of South America.
    
    Autocratic governments also were united to suppress every revolt and movement against any despotism.
    
    3. Holy Alliance -
        
        1. In 1815, rulers of **Austria, Britain, Russia and Prussia** formed an alliance. One of the major declared aims of this alliance was to **suppress any attempt by the people to overthrow a ruler** whom these countries considered the ‘**legitimate**’ ruler of the country. France joined soon.
        2. **Austria, Russia and Prussia** had formed another alliance which they called the **Holy Alliance**. In many countries, the freedom of the **press** was **abolished** and a large number of **spies** were **recruited** to keep watch on the activities of the revolutionaries. In **1830** revolutions broke out in a number of countries. The French **monarch fled** away to England and was succeeded by **Louis Philippe** who promised to rule according to the wishes of the people.
        3. Although most of these revolts were suppressed, the independence of two new nations was recognized— of **Greece in 1830 and of Belgium in 1839**.
    4. Revolutions of 1848
        
        1. Within a few years after the revolts of 1830 had been suppressed, the revolutionary movements in Europe again gained momentum. In 1848, revolutions broke out in almost every country of Europe, which dealt a **mortal blow to the countries of the Holy Alliance**.
        2. France - power was usurped through a **coup by Louis Bonaparte**, nephew of Napoleon, in 1852 who ruled till 1870.
        3. Prussia - uprisings followed in many towns and rulers had to agree to **several reforms**. Austrian empire in those days was a large empire ruling over many nations of Europe. It ruled over Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Poland, Yugoslavia and many other areas, and had its share of uprisings. Revolts were suppressed however **empire was badly shaken.**
        4. The most significant aspect of the 1848 revolutions was the emergence of a new political force in Europe. **Workers were a major force in the revolutions of 1848**. Their aim was not merely the overthrow of autocracies but also the **destruction of the economic system** that had grown with the Industrial Revolution— **capitalism**.
        5. Other participants in the revolutions— the capitalists, the merchants and other people belonging to the middle class—wanted **constitutional reforms**. Looked upon the demands of the workers for **social revolution with horror**. When the revolutionary movements were at their peak, they decided to **compromise** with the rulers.
    5. Democracy in England
        
        1. 1st successful revolution that **overthrew the autocratic monarchy** took place in England in 17th century. This had resulted in the establishment of the **supremacy of Parliament in England**. However, Parliament at that time was not a truly democratic institution.
        2. Right to vote was **limited** to a very small percentage of the population. Throughout 18th and 19th centuries, demand for making **Parliament a democratic institution grew.** Campaigns to extend the **right to vote to every citizen** were waged, led by radical leaders who represented the interests of workers, and the city poor, and by those representing the industrialist**s.**
        3. **Chartist Movement** was launched to get the right to vote for workers. Though the movement declined in the 1850’s, it left its influence and through the Acts of 1867, 1882, 1918 and **by 1929, all adult citizens were enfranchised**.
        4. Over 200 years after Parliament became supreme, that it became also a truly representative body of the British people.
    6. Unification of Germany
        
        1. ![GREAT BRITAIN BELGIUM -1 SC LE WIF HOLSTEIN MECKLEN SCHWERIN PRUSSIA KGD. SAXONY BOHEMIA BAVARIA WÜRTT ](Exported%20image%2020250424103724-0.tiff)
        2. In 18th century, Germany was **divided into a number of states**. Some of these states were very small and did not extend beyond the limits of a city. During the **Napoleonic wars, many of these states ceased** to exist. At the end of the wars there were **still 38 independent states** in Germany. Among them **Prussia**, **Wurttemberg**, **Bavaria**, and **Saxony** were fairly large.
        3. Prussia was the most powerful in militarily and in extent. It was also the most reactionary. The big landlords of Prussia known as **Junkers** formed the dominant section in Prussian society. Prussia was also one of the **leaders of the Holy Alliance**.
        4. With the growth of **national consciousness**, after French Revolution, people of these states started demanding national unification of Germany, **establishment of democratic government and social and economic reforms**. In 1815, German states along with Austria were organized into a **Germanic Confederation**. However, each state tried to preserve its independence and its oppressive political and social system.
        5. In 1848, revolts occurred in every German state and the r**ulers were forced to grant democratic constitutions**. To unite Germany and to frame a constitution for the united Germany, a **constituent assembly** met in Frankfurt. This Assembly proposed the unification of Germany as a **constitutional monarchy under the King of Prussia** who would become emperor of Germany.
        6. He did **not** wish to accept the crown from the elected representatives of the people (but from **College of Electors)**. Repression soon followed and even the rights that people had won in the initial stages of the revolution were taken away. Thousands of **German revolutionaries had to flee** the country and live in exile.
        7. With **failure of the revolution of 1848** to unify Germany, it was to be unified not into a democratic country by the efforts of revolutionaries but by the **rulers into a militaristic empire.**
        8. Leader of this policy was **Bismarck** who belonged to a Prussian aristocratic family. He wanted to preserve the **predominance of the landed aristocrats** and the army in the united German state and to achieve the unification of Germany under the leadership of the **Prussian monarchy.**
        9. Bismarck followed a policy of **‘blood and iron’ which meant a policy of war.** The first aim he pursued was the **elimination** of **Austria** from the Germanic Confederation. He aligned with Austria in **war against Denmark for** possession of **Schleswig and Holstein**. And then **against Austria** in alliance with Italy. After defeating Austria, he **eliminated** them from Germanic Confederation.
        10. In place of the old Confederation, he united **22 states of Germany** into North German Confederation in **1866**. The constitution of this Confederation made the **king of Prussia** the hereditary head of the Confederation. In 1866, most mid-sized German states had opposed Prussia, but by 1870 these states had been coerced and coaxed into **mutually protective alliances** **with Prussia**. In the event that a European state declared war on one of their members, they all would come to the **defense of the attacked state.** 
        11. With skillful manipulation of European politics, Bismarck created a situation in which France would **play the role of aggressor in German affairs**, while Prussia would play that of the **protector** of German rights and liberties. In 1870-71, southern kingdoms joined became German empire. **Alsace-Lorraine** **was annexed from France** in 1870 in war.
        12. In 1870, Louis Bonaparte, whose power had begun to collapse, declared war on Prussia in the hope of **maintaining his empire through a military victory**. The war was partly **provoked** by Bismarck. French armies were defeated and the French emperor was captured. After her defeat, France **finally became** a republic. Germany’s unification was completed as a result of the war which **enabled Bismarck to absorb** the remaining German states into a united Germany.
        13. Formal ceremony at which **King William I of Prussia** took the title of German Emperor was not held on German soil. It took place at **Versailles** in France, in the palace of the French kings. Germany soon underwent heavy **industrialization** in a very short period and soon joined the **scramble** for colonies.
    7. Unification of Italy
        
        1. ![KINGDOM SARDINI TUSCANY Aus rno "ancnr• PA p A L, STA t ](Exported%20image%2020250424103726-1.tiff)
        2. Like Germany, Italy was also **divided** into a number of states. The major states in the early 19th century Italy were **Sardinia**, **Lombardy**, **Venetia**, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (Sicily and Naples), Papal States, Tuscany, Parma and Modena.
        
        Of these the most powerful was the **kingdom of Sardinia.**
        
        4. Venetia and Lombardy were under **Austrian** occupation. Thus the Italian people were faced with the task of **expelling** the **Austrians** and forcing the rulers of independent states to unite. **Risorgimento** was an ideological and literary movement that helped to arouse the **national consciousness** of the Italian people, and it led to a series of political events that **freed the Italian states** from foreign domination and united them politically.
        5. Struggle for Italian independence and unification was organized by the two famous revolutionaries of Italy - **Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi** - and their secret society, the **Carboneri**. Movement led by them is known as the **‘Young Italy’ movement**. It aimed at the independence and unification of Italy and the establishment of a republic there.
        6. In 1848, as in other parts of Europe, revolutionary uprisings had broken out in Italy and the rulers were **forced to grant** certain democratic reforms to the people. However, the goal of independence and unification **was still distant.**
        7. King of Sardinia had introduced many reforms in the political system of his kingdom after the revolution of 1848. After this, his prime minister, **Count Cavour,** took the initiative of uniting Italy under the **leadership of** **Sardinia****.**
        8. Cavour’s policy in some ways was similar to that followed by Bismarck in Germany. Hoping to gain the support of Britain and France, he entered the **Crimean war in 1853-56 against Russia** even though Sardinia had no dispute with Russia. However, nothing came out of this war.
        9. In 1859, Cavour entered into an **alliance with Louis Bonaparte** and went to war with **Austria**. Although France soon withdrew from the war, Austria was **ousted from Lombardy**, which was taken over by Sardinia. Tuscany, Modena, Parma and the Papal States of the north also joined Sardinia. **Venetia, however, was still under** Austrian occupation.
        10. The other states that remained to be united with Sardinia were the **Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and Rome** which was under the rule of the Pope. An uprising had broken out in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. **Garibaldi** marched into the island of Sicily with his **revolutionary fighters** and liberated it from the rule of the king within three months. Then he marched to Naples in support of the revolt that had already broken out there.
        11. Italian revolutionaries were **not** perhaps strong enough to push the victory of the people in the Sicilies further with a **view to establishing a united** **republic** **of Italy**. Surrendered the former kingdom to the King of Sardinia, Victor Emmanuel II, who then took the title of **King of Italy in 1861.**
        12. Rome was still outside the kingdom of Italy. It was ruled **over by the Pope** with the help of the French soldiers provided to him by Louis Bonaparte. When the war between **France and Prussia broke out in 1870,** Bonaparte was forced to withdraw his troops from Rome. Italian soldiers occupied Rome and it **became capital of Italy in 1871.**
    8. Aftermath
        
        1. Unification of Germany and Italy, in spite of the fact that **democracy was not completely victorious there**, marked a great advance in the history of the two countries.
        2. One of the aspects of the movements described so far is the **gradual growth of political democracy**, that is, the ever increasing participation of increasing number of people in the political life of a country.
        3. New political and economic system that was **emerging in Europe in 19th century was also creating imperialism**. Period of the triumph of democracy and in Europe was also the period of the **conquest of Asia and Africa** by the imperialist powers of Europe. The 19==th== century saw the beginning of the revolts against imperialism in Asia and Africa. ￼
5. Socialism
    
    1. Workers gradually began to organize themselves **into trade unions** to protect their common rights though for a long time there were **laws against workers** combining themselves into unions.
        
        1. The governments were also **forced to pass laws** against some of the worse features of capitalism. For example, laws to protect workers from **unsafe conditions** of work were passed in many countries. Some progress was also made in regulating hours of work.
        2. Some workers had begun to think that **machines were the cause** of their misery. In England, there was a movement against machines **led the Luddites**
        3. In England, Chartist movement was started which aimed at **winning political rights for workers.** 
    2. Early socialists
        
        1. Idea grew that **capitalism itself is evil** and that it needs to be replaced by a different kind and economic system in which the means a **production would be owned by the society** as a whole and **not by a few individuals.** #important
        2. Many philosophers and reformers in the past had expressed **their revulsion against inequalities in society** and in favour of a system in which everyone would be equal
        3. French Revolution did **not** usher in an era of equality in economic, social and political life. Gap between the **aims of the French Revolution and the actual conditions** in France after the revolution **created serious discontent** among the people. It led to an attempt to overthrow the existing government in France with a view to building a **society based on socialist ideas**.
            
            1. **Babeuf Conspiracy** - organized a secret society called the Society of the Equals. Babeuf, in a manifesto, had declared, “Nature gave everyone an equal right to the enjoyment of all goods…in a true society, there is **no room for either rich or poor**”.
            2. The society planned an uprising but the government came to know of the plan and in 1796, a large number of leaders including Babeuf were arrested. Babeuf was executed in 1797. Though Babeuf’s attempt at overthrowing the government had failed, his **ideas** exercised an important influence on the **growth of socialist movement.**
        4. Utopian socialists - viewed **property in relation to its usefulness** to the society. Recognized the **evils of capitalism** and proposed the establishment of a new and better system of society in its place. 
            
            1. They visualized a society **free from exploitation** of any kind and one in which all would contribute their **best and would share** the fruits of their labor. However, the methods they advocated for the establishment of such a society were **impracticable** and **ineffective**.
            2. **Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier & Robert Owen** were associated with this school of though
        5. Those who helped in spreading ideas of early socialism. **Louis-Auguste Blanqui** (1805-81) who played a **leading role in every uprising in Paris from the 1830’s to 1871**. He believed that through a revolutionary conspiracy, power could be **captured** to bring about socialism.
    3. Communist League -
        
        1. Many groups formed to **spread socialist ideas and organize workers**. One of these was the **League of the Just** which had members in many countries of Europe. Its slogan was ‘All men are brothers’. Thus **internationalism** was one of its important features.
        2. In 1847, its name was changed to the **Communist League** and it declared as its aim, _“the downfall of the bourgeoisie, the_ **rule of the proletariat**_, the overthrow of the old society of middle class, based on class distinction, and the_ **establishment of a new society without classes and without private property**_.”_ Its journal carried the slogan, “Proletarians of all lands, unite!” It instructed Karl Marx and Frederick Engels to draft a manifesto.
    4. Communist Manifesto first appeared in German in February **1848**. Influence of this in history of **socialist movement is unparalleled**. It was the work of Karl Marx and his lifelong associate Frederick Engels.
        
        1. Through their work in the socialist movement and through their numerous writings, they gave a **new direction to socialist ideology and movement**. Their philosophy is known as **Marxism** and it has influenced almost every field of knowledge. Their view of socialism is called **scientific socialism**.
        2. Communist Manifesto stated that the aim of workers all over the world was the **overthrow of capitalism** and the establishment of socialism. “In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class differences”, it said “appears an association in which the **free development of each is the condition** for the free development of all”.
    5. Marxian beliefs - Marx analysed the working of capitalism in his famous work **Das Kapital** and pointed out the characteristics that would lead to its destruction.
        
        1. Workers **produce** **more ‘value’** **than they get in the form of wages**, the difference being appropriated by the capitalists in the form of profits.
        2. This constitutes the **basis of conflict** in capitalist society. Profits can be increased at the cost of workers’ wages and, therefore, the **interests** of workers and capitalists are **irreconcilable**.
        3. Economic crises were inevitable under capitalism because of the **discrepancy between the purchasing power of workers and total production**. These crises would be resolved only if the private ownership of the means of production is abolished and the **profit motive eliminated** from the system of production.
        4. Exploiting classes would disappear and a **classless society would emerge** in which there would be **no difference** between what was good for the individual and for society as a whole.
        5. Marx and Engels believed that this would be accomplished by the **working class which was the most revolutionary class** in capitalist society. They advocated that the emancipation of the working class would **emancipate the whole human race** from all traces of social injustice.
        6. 'Socialism' in the 1840s was a term **without a consensus definition**, meaning different things to different people, but was typically used within a **context of more power for workers** in a system based on worker ownership of the means of production.
    6. After 1848
        
        1. With the **failure of the 1848 revolutions**, the socialist movement seems to have abated. However, it was soon to rise in strength again, due to the **internationalist character** of various socialist groups
        2. In Britain, Society of Fraternal Democrats had been formed in 1846. It had close links with other similar organizations in Europe and with the Chartists in Britain. All these organizations emphasized the idea that the **cause of the working class in all countries** was the same.
    7. First International
        
        1. One of the most important events in the history of the socialist movement was the formation in **1864 of the** **International Working Men’s Association****, or the First International**. With its formation, socialism stepped on the stage of history as a **world movement**.
        2. The first meeting took place in London and was attended by delegates from all over Europe. Marx drafted the inaugural address which outlined the principles and aims of the International. Emancipation of the working classes **must be won by the working classes** themselves. The central aim of the International was declared to be the **total ‘abolition of all class rule’.**
        3. International was considered by the governments of the time as a **menace and attempts were made to exterminate it.** It was persecuted and declared illegal in many countries.
        4. During the short period of its existence, the International exercised a **tremendous influence on workers’ movements** in Europe and North America. It played a particularly important role in **creating bonds of international solidarity** by arranging **aid from workers** of many countries in support of the workers’ struggle in any particular country.
        5. One of the finest examples of **workers’ solidarity** was evidenced at the time of the war between Prussia and France in 1870. Workers' groups **across the kingdoms sent messages of good wishes and solidarity** to each other
        6. It **collapsed** as a result of **internal** differences. The International was not a **homogeneous organization**. It represented many different trends in the workers’ movement. Due to **differences on aims and methods,** it was split in 1872 and was formally dissolved in 1876. 
    8. Paris Commune 1871
        
        1. War between France and Prussia led to another important development—**an uprising by the workers of Paris and the** **seizure of-power by them**. This is one of the most important events in the history of socialism.
        2. Within a few weeks of the war the French army had been defeated and the French emperor Louis Bonaparte had been taken prisoner. A new government had come into being and had **declared France a republic.** 
        3. This government was dominated by the propertied classes and had agreed to Bismarck’s terms for **truce including the surrender of Paris**, cession of **Alsace**-**Lorraine** and the payment of a **huge war indemnity**. The workers of Paris regarded the surrender by the government as **treacherous**. They refused to surrender. The government withdrew from Paris in February 1871 and asked for **German help to crush Paris.**
        4. Workers of Paris elected a council in March 1871 assumed the title of the **Paris Commune**. It was elected by universal adult franchise and represented the workers and the lower middle classes of Paris. It proclaimed as its aim “the **ending of exploitation**, stock-exchange speculation, **monopolies and privileges** to which the proletariat attributes its slavery, and the fatherland its misery and ruin”. All public offices were **elected by universal suffrage** with people having the right to recall.
        5. Paris Commune was the result of an upsurge in which the workers had played the dominant role, the **result of the first workers’ revolution** in history. But was soon drowned in blood. French government which had established its headquarters in **Versailles** attacked Paris with a huge army with help of Germans. **Paris Commune was exterminated.**
    9. Second International
        
        1. In the 1870’s and 80s socialist parties were formed across Europe with some having lakhs of members. They participated in **national elections** and in some countries came to have a **fairly large representation** in the parliament. Similarly, the strength and membership of the **trade unions also increased** and there were many strikes.
        2. To unite the socialist parties in various countries into an international organization, a Congress was held in Paris on 14 July **1889**, the **centenary** of the French Revolution of 1789. The result of this was **Second International.** 
        3. This was a new stage in the history of socialism. An important step taken at the Congress was to make the **1st May every year** as a day of working class solidarity. It was decided to organize on that day a **great international demonstration** in such a way that all lands and cities will simultaneously demand from the powers that be a limitation the **working day to 8 hours**. On the **1st May 1890**, millions of workers all over Europe and America held strikes and massive demonstrations. Beginning of International Labor Day.
        4. Period after the formation a the Second International saw a **steady increase in the strength of the socialist parties** and of trade unions. They had become a major force across Europe.
    10. Second International & War
        
        1. Most significant achievements were its **campaign against militarism and war** and in asserting the principle of **basic equality of all peoples** and their right to freedom and national independence.
        2. Last decade of 19th century saw **increased militarization** - Europe was getting divided into **groups of warring blocs**, the struggle for colonies being the main cause of conflicts between them. 
        3. **Struggle against militarism** and the **prevention of war** became the major aims of the Second International and of the socialist parties affiliated to it. They expressed the conviction that **capitalism was the root cause of war.**
        4. Also decided that the socialists should utilize the economic and political crisis created by the war, to rouse the masses and thereby to **hasten the downfall of capitalist rule**. They **suffered** at the hands of their governments who were preparing for war.
        5. Second International also condemned **colonialism** and committed the socialist parties to **oppose the robbery and subjugation** of colonial peoples. **1904 Congress was attended by Dadabhai Naoroji,** who pleaded the cause of India’s freedom. He was supported by the British delegates at the Congress.
    11. Limitation of Second International
        
        1. It was a **loose federation** of socialist parties of many countries. While the socialist parties in many countries had become **mass parties, basic differences had arisen** among them.
        2. While some sections believed in the **necessity of a revolution** to overthrow capitalism, others began to believe that socialism could be achieved **through gradual reforms.** The latter were willing to support the existing governments in certain circumstances. Some sections in the **socialist parties even favored colonialism.**
        3. On the question of war, while the attitude of the Second International was clear, many **socialist parties had serious differences**. It was the question of the war that the Second International suffered a fatal blow. **When WW1 broke out**, most of the socialist parties extended their support to their respective governments. This had serious consequences for the socialist movement. The **Second International ceased to function** and the socialist movement in every country was split. ￼
6. Imperialism
    
    1. Imperialism is **practice** of **extending power, control or rule by country** over political and economic life of **areas outside its own borders**. This maybe done through **military or other means**, particularly through **colonialism**. Colonialism in practice of **acquiring colonies by conquest** or other means and making them dependent on **imperialist** country.
        
        1. Occupation of or direct rule over a country or people by another country is **not always** an essential feature of imperialism
        2. Essential feature is **EXPLOITATION**, with or without direct political control.
        3. While most countries which came under direct imperialist rule are **now politically independent, economic exploitation** has not ended. This has been termed as neocolonialism.
    2. 1st phase of the imperialist control and colonization of Asia, Africa and the Americas **began in 16th century.** Voyages of discovery were followed by the founding of vast colonial empires by Portugal, Spain, Holland, England and France in the Americas.
        
        1. **Spain occupied most of South America** (excluding Brazil which was occupied by Portugal), Central America, Mexico, West Indies and parts of what is now the United States of America.
        2. England and France occupied **parts of North America**. Many people from these countries of Europe went to settle in these colonies permanently
        3. During this period, the European control in Africa extended only to about 20% of continent, **mainly in the coastal areas.**
        4. European slave traders **enslaved and transported about 5000 Africans to the Americas every month** during the 17th century to overcome the shortage of manual labor in the new world
        5. In Asia, the Europeans came mainly with the purpose of trade. Trading companies from Portugal, Holland, England, France and other countries, with the backing of their respective monarchs, **set up their trading posts and tried to establish their monopoly of trade** with the countries of Asia, and each tried to exclude the others through war and by extending their political influence and control. 
        6. **Portuguese** who controlled the trade with Asia were ousted from that position by the **Dutch** (Indonesia) and the **English** (India) who extended their control
        7. Period bw 16th-17th century was **naked plunder by colonial powers** - led to growth of **capitalism and industrial revolution.**
    3. New phase of imperialism began in **1875 as pursuit of colonies** reemerged as a result of **economic and political system** that developed along with industrial revolution (as European kingdoms were unified as **nation states).**
        
        1. Forms of control and domination including **direct colonial rule, spheres of influence and various types** of economic and commercial agreements 
        2. Powers of Spain and Portugal declined and **Britain & France continued to expand**. Germany, Italy, Belgium, USA and later Japan, had joined the race.
    4. Conditions that led to growth of imperialism - **more powerful nations made imperialism seem necessary and natural**
        
        1. **Demands created by industrial revolution** - resulted in a great increase in the production of goods and created capitalist system of production.
            
            1. Production of goods was **far in excess of the demand at home**, and low wages meant low purchasing power of majority. European countries could find markets for their **surplus goods in Asia and Africa** where the Industrial Revolution had not taken place. Selling was made easier through **political domination.**
            2. In addition to markets, European countries needed **new sources of raw materials**. As industries grew, more and more raw materials were needed to feed those industries. 
            3. India and Egypt were **good sources of cotton**, Congo and the East Indies, of **rubber** and other products needed were food grains, tea, coffee, indigo, tobacco and sugar
            4. Abundance of raw materials in Asia and Africa, and the number of people who could be **made to work for lower wages** made the two continents very attractive to investors. From about the end of the 19th century, **export of capital for investment in other countries began to become more important** than the export of goods. However, investments were **not safe without** political domination.
        2. Improvement in transportation and communication - changes in **transport and communication** made spread of imperialism easier. Steamships could carry goods much faster, railroads and inland waterways were built for transport of raw materials and finished products.
        3. Extreme nationalism - from mid-19th century onwards, there was a period of **intense nationalism**. Many nations developed **myths of their superiority** over other peoples. Writers and speakers in England, France and Germany opened institutions to **promote the idea of imperialism**, and took great pride in calling their territories empires
            
            1. Imperialist countries took over some places in Asia and Africa because of their **military or strategic importance**. England needed Port Said, Aden, Hong Kong, Singapore and Cyprus —not to protect England but to **protect her conquered lands** and trade route to India **from rival nations.**
        4. **Civilizing mission** - in minds of many Europeans, imperialist expansion was **very noble**. They considered it a way of bringing civilization to the backward peoples of the world. Rudyard Kipling, asked his countrymen to shoulder what he called ‘**the white man’s burden’**. **Christian missionarie**s also played their part in promoting the idea of imperialism. 
        5. Explorers and adventurers - helped in spreading imperialism. They went into unknown or little known territories and brought back reports that often **indicated opportunities for trade and development.**
    5. Most important condition **favoring the imperialist** conquest of Asia and Africa was that the **Industrial Revolution had not come** to this part of the world.
        
        1. Production was **still on a small scale** and lack of industrial knowledge also put militaries of these lands at a **disadvantage**
        2. Govt of countries in Asia and Africa were **weak after break up of** empires of middle ages. People’s loyalties were still to **local princes as in feudal times,** or to tribal chieftains, who cared little for the welfare of the people. 
    6. Conquest of Asia
        
        1. British in India - **Decline of the Mughal empire** in India gave the British and the French, who had come to trade, an opportunity to conquer India. After the Revolt of 1857, the British government **took over direct control of India.** Many princely states survived but they were free only in name.
            
            1. Conflict between the English and French was over **establishing a monopoly of trade**. After the English dominance, **fortunes were made** by the officers of the Company. India was known as the brightest jewel of the British empire.
            2. **Millions of pounds were drained** out of India to England in the form of profits and as payment to the British government as **direct tribute and Home Charges.**
            3. In 1883, **all import and export duties were waived.** Indian resources, both human and material, were used to **promote the interests of British imperialism** in China, Central Asia and Africa
        2. China - **Imperialist domination** began with what are known as **the Opium Wars** (1839-42 & 1856-60)
            
            1. Before these wars, **only two ports were open** to foreign traders. British merchants bought Chinese tea, silk and other goods, but there was **no market for British goods** in China.
            2. Then British merchants **started smuggling opium into China** on a large scale. The illegal opium trade was **profitable** to the British traders but did immense **physical and moral damage to the Chinese.**
            3. In 1839, when a Chinese government official seized an opium cargo and destroyed it, **Britain declared war and easily defeated the Chinese.** 
            4. Chinese were then forced to **pay heavy damages to the British** and to open **five port cities** to British traders. British subjects in these ports would be tried for any crimes in English rather than in Chinese courts (**extraterritorial rights**). Chinese government was **no longer free to impose tariff** on foreign goods The island of **Hong Kong was turned over to Britain**
            5. Soon France entered into similar **unequal** treaties with China. On the pretext that a French missionary had been murdered, **England and France fought another war with China.** China was defeated and was forced to **grant more privileges to her conquerors.**
            6. Japanese entered China to **increase their influence over Korea**, which was under Chinese over lordship. After war with Japan in 1894-95, China was forced to grant **independence to Korea and cede Formosa (Taiwan) to Japanese**. Also paid $150m in war damages.
            7. France, Russia, Britain and Germany **gave loans to China to help her to meet this payment**. But they divided China into **spheres of influence.** ￼Germany got **Kiauchau** Bay and exclusive rights in **Shandong** and **Hwang Ho** valley. ￼Russia took **Liaotung** Peninsula, along with the right to build railroads in **Manchuria**. ￼France received **Kwangchow Bay** and extensive rights in three southern provinces of China ￼Britain got **Weihaiwei** in addition to her sphere of influence in the **Hong Kong.**
            ![Image result for china sphere of influence map](Exported%20image%2020250424103728-2.jpeg)
        3. Open Door Policy - United States feared that China would be completely parceled out in exclusive spheres of influence and that **its trade with China would be shut off.** All countries would have **equal rights to trade anywhere in China.** Britain **supported** the United States thinking that this policy would **discourage the annexation of China by Japan and Russia**.
            
            1. Scramble for privileges stopped in China after an **uprising against the foreign powers known as the** **Boxer Rebellion** (1899-1901, background: severe drought and disruption caused by the growth of foreign spheres of influence) But the foreign powers were victorious and levied **heavy damages on China as punishment**
            2. Imperialism continued, with the **cooperation of Chinese warlords (Beiyang cliques)**. These military commanders were supported by the **loans which they got from foreign powers in exchange for more privileges.**
    7. South East Asia - Even before the rise of the new imperialism, many of these countries were **already dominated** by the Europeans.
        
        1. Indo-China consists of **Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam**. When England was fighting China over the opium trade, France was trying to **extend her commerce in Indo-China**. In a series of planned steps which included threats of war, France became the **master of Indo-China** and the separate states were grouped together under a French Governor-General.
        2. Burma - In 1880, the **king of Burma gave France the right to build a railway from Tonkin to Mandalay**. British government, fearing French expansion, **started a war with Burma**. The Burmese king was captured and sent to India; **Burma was annexed and became a part of Britain’s empire in India in** **1886****.**
        3. Philippines - United States **occupied it in 1898 after Spanish-American War** (main issue was Cuban independence, revolt of the Cubans in the Caribbean against Spanish rule). There was a revolt of the **Filipinos against Spanish rule** and the United States **occupied Cuba and the Philippines**. The Filipinos revolted against the American occupation but were suppressed and the **Philippines became an American possession.**
    8. Central & West Asia - England and Russia were **rivals in the struggle to control Central Asia, Iran (Persia), Afghanistan and Tibet.**
        
        1. Russian empire succeeded in **annexing almost all of Central Asia** in the second half of 19th century.
        2. Conflict between England and Russia came to a head over Iran and Afghanistan, however, **England was more keen on defending India.**
        3. Russia agreed to recognize Afghanistan as being outside her influence and Britain agreed not to annex Afghanistan as long as her ruler remained loyal to her.
        4. **North Iran was Russian sphere of influence, south was for British** and central was kept neutral. However, after 1917, Russia withdrew. Iran remained nominally independent but was increasingly **under the domination of foreign oil companies** - **Standard Oil** Company of the United States and the **Anglo Persian** Oil Company of England.
        5. In 1907, both agreed not to interfere in Tibet.
        6. Germany, during these years, was extending **her influence over Turkey and the Asian possessions of the Turkish empire**. A railroad from Istanbul to Baghdad was planned. Through this, Germany hoped to **promote her economic interests in this region,** and on to Iran and India. France, England and Russia opposed this, but an agreement to divide the region was **reached between Germany, France and England**. The First World War, however, changed the situation. **Oil and the concessions to control oil resources** became the major objectives of the imperialist countries in Western Asia. American oil companies, in partnership with England and France, got oil concessions in Arabia.
    9. Japan as imperialist power - **started in 1890s**. In 1867, after a change in government, known as **Meiji Restoration****, Japan began to modernize her economy.** Within a few decades, she became one of the **most industrialized** countries of the world.
        
        1. But the forces that made many of the Western countries imperialist were also active in the case of Japan. Japan had **few raw materials** **to support her industries**. So she looked for lands that had them and for markets to sell her manufactured goods.
        2. War between **China and Japan over Korea in 1894.** After this, Japan’s influence in China increased. **Anglo Japanese Treaty of 1902** **recognized her as a power of equal standing** with the great European powers.
        3. **In 1904-05 she defeated Russia.** As a result of this war, the **southern half of** **Sakhalin** was ceded to Japan. Japan also gained control of the southern part of the **Liaotung Peninsula** with Port Arthur which was leased to her. **In 1910, Korea became a colony of Japan.** ￼
7. Imperialism in Africa - From the time of European explorations from mid-15th century, a new phase began in the history of some parts of Africa.
    
    1. **Slave trade** - European penetration of Africa was confined for a **long time mainly to certain coastal** areas. However, even these limited contacts led to the **most tragic and disastrous consequences for the people of Africa**. One of the first results of these contacts was the purchase and sale of people - the slave trade.
        
        1. Spanish rule in the Americas had resulted in the **large-scale extermination of the original inhabitants of the Americas**. Portuguese had established a **slave market in Lisbon (started slave trade) and the Spaniards bought slaves from there** and took them to their colonies in the Americas to work there. African villages were **raided by slave traders and people were captured** and handed over to the European traders.
        2. Earlier, the **Arabs had dominated the slave trade**. Subsequently, some **African chiefs** also took part in the slave trade by trading slaves **in exchange for firearms** which the European traders sold to them.
        3. **Europeans themselves also raided the villages and enslaved** the people, who were then transported. When the demand for slaves in America increased, they were sent **directly from Africa by the traders.**
        4. Millions of **Africans were uprooted** from their homes. Many were killed while resisting the raids on their villages by the traders. It is estimated that **not even half of the slaves captured reached America alive.** Inhuman conditions under which they were forced to work on the plantations cannot even be imagined today. Extreme brutalities were inflicted on those who tried to escape. Slavery had become an **integral part of the colonial system**.
        5. Slavery was also a **hindrance** if the interior of Africa was to be opened to colonial exploitation. Some colonial powers used the **pretext of abolishing slave trade to go to war against African chiefs** and kings to expand their territorial possessions.
    2. Scramble for Africa - interior of Africa was **almost unknown to the Europeans up to mid -19th century**. Coastal regions were largely in the hands of the **old trading nations** - Portuguese, the Dutch, the English and the French. In the north the **French had conquered Algeria**. In the south the English had **occupied Cape Colony** to safeguard their commerce with India. It had earlier been a Dutch colony. These settlers, known as **Boers, had taken to farming.**
        
        1. **Explorers, traders and missionaries** -  played their respective roles in the conquest of Africa, The explorers aroused the **Europeans’ interest in Africa**. The missionaries saw the continent as a place for spreading the message of Christianity. The interests created by explorers and missionaries were soon used by the traders. 
        2. Even though the European powers **met with stiff resistance from the Africans** and it took them a long time to establish effective occupation of their colonies, the speed with which the European powers conquered Africa is without a parallel. 
        3. "Whatever happens, we have got, the maxim gun and they have not."
        4. Africa was also not divided into united nation-states **but into warring factions**, who often sought **European support against their rivals**. As against this, the imperialist countries participating in the scramble for Africa were united.
        5. Scramble to grab the maximum of African territory in the **shortest possible time was the result of these rivalries**. Many a time during the scramble wars between these countries were imminent. But in **every case, war was avoided and agreements reached** between them as to who will get which part of Africa.

        7. In 1884-85, there was a **Congress in Berlin** where a group of European states met and discussed **how to carve out Africa** among themselves. No African state was represented at this Congress.
        8. Treaties were **signed between European powers** to settle disputes over claims to African territories between themselves. Treaties were also signed between **African rulers and chiefs, and the representatives** of European governments or European companies.
        9. A look at the map of Africa after partition will show how the continent of Africa was **partitioned on paper in conference rooms in Europe** (paper partition). About 30% of all boundaries in Africa are in straight lines.
    3. Belgium - In 1878, with the **financial assistance of King Leopold II** of Belgium, H. M. Stanley founded the **International Congo Association** which made over 400 treaties with African chiefs who didn't know they were transferring their **land to the Congo Association in exchange for cloth or other articles of no great value**. Stanley acquired large tracts of land by these methods. In 1885 some **2.3 million sq km,** rich in rubber and ivory, became the **‘Congo Free State’ with Leopold as its king.**
        
        1. However, treatment of the **Congolese people was so bad** that even other colonial powers were shocked. In 1908, Leopold was **compelled to hand** over the Congo Free State to the Belgian government, and it became known as **Belgian Congo.** Gradually, **Congo’s gold, diamond, uranium, timber and copper** became more important than her rubber and ivory. More countries joined the exploitation.
    4. French - Frenchman, **de Brazza,** was active north of the Congo river. Following the methods of Stanley, **de Brazza won the area for France**, this area became what was until recently called the French Congo with its **capital town named Brazzaville**.
        
        1. More territories were **added to the West African conquests after 1900** and **French West Africa** came to include present Senegal, French Guinea, the Ivory Coast, Dahomey, Mauritania, French Sudan, Upper Volta and Niger Territory. The **French conquest resulted in brutal** exploitation of the people everywhere in Africa.
    5. Germany - **After 1880, Germany also got very interested** in possessions in Africa
        
        1. First occupied an area called **Togoland** on the west coast; soon after, the **Cameroons**, a little farther south.
        2. Still farther south, the Germans established themselves in South-west Africa (**Namibia**) where, to suppress local rebels, more than **half of the population was exterminated**.
    6. With the **exception of Liberia**, the whole of West Africa was divided up among the Europeans. Liberia was **settled by slaves who had been freed** in America.
    7. **Rhodesia - English adventurer, Cecil Rhodes**, came to south Africa in 1870, made a fortune in **mining diamond and gold** of this region and gave his name to an African colony **Rhodesia** (present Zambia and Zimbabwe).
        
        1. British occupied Bechuanaland, Rhodesia, Swaziland and Basutoland. **They plotted the overthrow of the Boer government of Transvaal which was rich in gold.** This led to the Boer War (1899-1902) in which the **Boers** were **defeated** though they continued to remain there.
        2. Soon after this, the **Union of South Africa** was formed consisting of the **Cape**, **Natal**, **Transvaal** and **Orange River** Colony. **Ruled by white minority** —Boers, Englishmen, and other European countries. 
    8. East Africa - Except for the Portuguese possession of a part of Mozambique, **East Africa had not been occupied by any European power before 1884.**
        
        1. Using bribery and threats, **Carl Peters** persuaded some rulers to sign agreements placing themselves **under German protection**
        2. Since France and Britain also had plans in this area, an agreement was signed by which **France got Madagascar**, and East Africa was divided between **Germany (Tanzania) and England (Kenya).**
        3. After WW1, Tanzania went to England, Rwanda-Burundi to Belgium.
    9. Italy - entered the **colonial race late.** Italians occupied two desert areas in horn of Africa - **Somaliland and Eritrea. Abyssinia**, now known as Ethiopia, was an independent state and Italy wanted to declare it as its **protectorate** and invaded her. **They were defeated in 1896**. Ethiopia was also **never colonized**, though **occupied by Italians** before WW2.
    10. North Africa - **Algeria was conquered by France** in 1830. It was the most profitable of France’s colonial possessions, providing her a **vast market** for French goods. Tunisia was coveted by France, England and Italy. According to an agreement in 1878, **England gave France a free hand** in Tunisia in return for British occupation of the **island of Cyprus**.
    11. Morocco - Both France and Italy wanted to claim it as their territory.
        
        1. They agreed, in 1900, to the **French occupation of Morocco** and to the Italian occupation of **Tripoli and Cyrenaica** (renamed Libya)
        2. In 1904, France and England signed an agreement which gave **Morocco to France, and Egypt to England.**
        3. Spain had been **promised Tangier** in return for French occupation of Morocco. So it became necessary to **appease German ambition** in North Africa - by giving **parts of French Congo**.
    12. Egypt - was a **province** of the Turkish empire. A French company had **gained** a **concession** from **Ismail Pasha,** Governor of Egypt, to **dig a canal across the isthmus of Suez**. The canal was completed in 1869 and aroused British interest in the area.
        
        1. Financial troubles of the Pasha led to **increased joint Anglo-French** control over Egypt. When the Pasha tried to resist, he was **forced to abdicate** and a new governor was appointed
        2. In 1882, there was a revolt **against the Anglo-French control** and, in suppressing the revolt, the **British armies conquered Egypt**.
        3. In 1922, though she still **retained her rights over the Suez** and many other concessions, Britain was forced to recognize Egypt as an independent sovereign state.￼
8. Americas and Pacific - **By 1820s, almost all countries of the Americas had gained their independence** from Spain and Portugal. Only a few colonies ruled by European countries were left in this part of the world. Among these were **Cuba and Puerto Rico** which were still under Spanish rule and a few others under British, French, Dutch and Danish rule.
    
    1. The United states in 19th century emerged as the **biggest power in the Americas.** Extended territories through **war with Mexico and purchase of Louisiana (France), Florida (Spain) and Alaska (Russia).**
        
        1. Within a short period after the Civil War (1861-65) which ended in the abolition of slavery, the **United States emerged as a major industrial and military power** in the world. By 1900, her **naval strength was third in the world.**
        2. Forces that had led to the emergence of imperialism in Europe and later in Japan also **led to the emergence of the United States as a major imperialist power.**
        3. After the American-Spanish War, the **Philippines** had become a U.S. colony. USA had also taken **Puerto Rico and Guam** from Spain, and **Cuba** (independent in name).
    2. Monroe Doctrine - USA spread its **control over South America and the Pacific**. In 1823, Monroe made four basic points
        
        1. USA will **not interfere in the internal affairs** of or the wars between European powers
        2. Recognized and **would not interfere with existing colonies** and dependencies in the Western Hemisphere
        3. Western Hemisphere was **closed to future colonization**; and
        4. Any attempt by a European power to oppress or control any nation in the Western Hemisphere would be **viewed as a hostile act against the United States.** 
        5. In 1904, Britain and Germany had imposed a **naval blockade of Venezuela as she had failed to repay the loan** which she had taken from them. Roosevelt **forced** Britain and Germany to lift the blockade and declared that the United States **alone had the right to intervene** in the affairs of her neighboring countries if they were unable to maintain order on their own. 
        6. Took **control of the finances of Dominican Republic** which she retained for three decades and occupied that country in 1916 for eight years.
        7. In 1906, American troops were **sent to Cuba** and remained there for three years to ‘protect’ Cuba from disorder.
        8. In Mexico, where the United States had huge investments, **Francisco Madero, a popular leader was deposed** with the support of the United States The intervention by the United States in Mexico continued for many years.
    3. Dollar Diplomacy - policy of the United States was described as the **‘Big Stick’ policy and one of an ‘international policeman’**. The extension of the **USA influence through economic investments** in the region is known as the ‘Dollar diplomacy’
        
        1. Economic and political **domination of South America** was facilitated by the absence of strong governments in the countries of South America.
        2. Many of these countries were **ruled by corrupt military leaders with armed gangs.** They floated **loans for ready cash and sold concessions to foreign companies** to exploit the natural resources of their countries.
        3. They served as **markets for manufactures,** and **sources of raw materials** for industrialized countries, particularly the United States, as well as **avenues for investment of capital** from these countries
    4. Panama Canal - A French company had started the **construction of the canal** in the Isthmus of Panama in Colombia. Canal which would link the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans was of **great economic interest**. In 1901, the United States decided to undertake the canal project alone
        
        1. Paid $40 million to the French company and entered into an agreement with the government of Colombia. $10m + $250k annual rent, which was **against interests of Colombians and who refused to ratify the deal.**
        2. In 1903, USA **financed and organized a revolt in Panama** and landed her troops there. USA recognized **Panama as an independent state** and new govt granted **10 mile canal zone**. Canal was opened in 1914 and was **passed on to Panama in 1999.**
    5. Hawaii - islands of Hawaii had been important for American **shipping** and for trade with **China**.
        
        1. USA's economic and commercial **influence gradually increased** in these islands and with the settling of Americans there, particularly as **sugar planters**
        2. USA secured the **exclusive use of Pearl Harbor as a naval station**. In 1893, the American residents in the Hawaii islands revolted **against the queen of Hawaii** and, asked for the annexation of the islands by the United States, which was **done by 1898.**￼
9. Effects of Imperialism
    
    1. **Economic backwardness** - industrialization of these countries was prevented. Where industries were started, these were subordinated to the interests of the industries of the imperialist countries or for making profits for the companies of the imperialist countries. **Naked plunder of natural resources**, and exploitation through high demands of revenues and taxes. 
    2. **Racism** - Imperialism also **bred racial arrogance and discrimination.** The idea of the superiority of the white race whom God had created to govern the world, was popularized in the imperialist countries. Japanese were called **'honorary whites'.**
    3. Getting possession of new markets and raw materials and establishing industries to be worked by cheap labor created **many ‘small’** **wars and two world conflicts****.** Despite the ‘gentlemen’s agreements’, there was a continuous effort among the western powers to re-divide the world as between themselves but **never with any consideration for the welfare** of the people to whom the territory really belonged.￼
10. WW1 - In the earlier wars, the **civilian populations were not generally involved** and the casualties were generally **confined to the warring** armies.
    
    1. The war which began in 1914 was a **total war in which all the resources of the warring states were mobilized.**
        
        1. It affected the **economy of the entire world** the casualties suffered by the civilian population from bombing of the civilian areas and the famines and epidemics, caused by the war **far exceeded those suffered by the armies.**
        2. In its impact also, the **war had no precedent**. It marked a turning point in world history. The battles of the war were fought in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Pacific. Because of the **unprecedented extent** of its spread and its total nature, it is known as the First World War.
    2. Underlying causes of the war were the **rivalries and conflicts** among the imperialist countries. **In short - alliances, imperialism, militarism, nationalism and finally the assassination.**
        
        1. Wars were generally avoided at that time because the **possibilities of further conquest were still there**. By end of 19th century, however, the situation had changed. Further conquests could take place **only by dispossessing some imperialist** country of its colonies.
        2. Germany entered the scramble for colonies late. After the unification of Germany had been achieved, it made **tremendous economic progress.** By 1914, it had left Britain and France far behind in the **production of iron and steel** and in many manufactures. It had entered the **shipping trade in a big way** and was expanding its Navy at a great pace, much to the discomfort of Britain and France.
        3. Japan which had also **become an imperialist power had ambitions in the Far East** and was on way to fulfilling them. She defeated Russia in 1904/05 after having signed an agreement with Britain and was able to **extend her influence in the Far East.**
        4. Rise of any other country was **considered a danger to the British empire**. She also had her vast international trade to defend against the competition from other countries
    3. Conflicts within Europe - 6 major powers in Europe at this time—Britain, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, France and Italy.
        
        1. Almost all these countries **got involved concerned the countries** comprising the Balkan peninsula in Europe - **the Balkan Question**
        2. Balkan countries had been **under the rule of Ottoman Turks**. However, in 19th century, Ottoman rule had **begun to collapse.** There were **revolts by various nationalities** for independence.
        3. **Russian Tsars** hoped that these areas would come under their control once the Ottomans were ousted from there. They encouraged a **movement called the Pan-Slav movement** which was based on the theory that all the **Slavs of eastern Europe were one people.**
        4. Major Balkan country, Serbia, led the movement for **uniting the areas inhabited by the Slavs** in the Ottoman empire as well as in Austria-Hungary. Serbian nationalism was **encouraged by Russia**, which alarmed other European powers.
        5. Corresponding to the Pan-Slav movement, there was a **Pan-German movement** which aimed at the **expansion of Germany all over central Europe** and in the Balkans. Italy claimed certain areas which were **under Austrian rule.** France hoped to recover **not only Alsace Lorraine** which she had lost to Germany in 1871 but also to **wreak vengeance** on Germany
    4. Alliances - because of these conflicts over imperialism and nationalism, European countries began to **form themselves into opposing groups.**
        
        1. Europe was gradually becoming a **vast armed camp** due to military build up. Simultaneously, **propaganda for war, to breed hatred** against other countries, to paint one’s own country as superior to others, and to **glorify war,** was started in each country.
        2. **Triple Alliance** - was formed in 1882 comprising **Germany, Austria-Hungary  and Italy.** However, Italy’s loyalty to this Alliance was **uncertain** as her main aim was to gain territories in Europe from Austria-Hungary and in conquering Tripoli with French support.
        3. **Triple Entente** - emerged opposed to Alliance, comprising **France, Russia and Britain** in 1907. In theory it was only a **loose group** based on mutual understanding as the word ‘Entente’.

    5. Events before the war - outbreak of the war was preceded by a series of incidents which added to the prevailing tension and ultimately led to the war.
        
        1. **Clash over Morocco** - In 1904 Britain and France had entered into a secret agreement according to which **Britain was to have a free hand in Egypt, and France was to take over Morocco**. The agreement became known to Germany and aroused her indignation. Germany promised support for **full independence to Morocco (1st Moroccan Crisis).** In 1911, however was averted, and Germany was made to **appease with a part of French Congo, following Agadir crisis (2nd)**. This was a setback to German **weltpolitik** (foreign policy from **1890s** onward. Realpolitik was defensive policy Bismarck era)
        2. **Balkans** - In 1908 Austria annexed the Ottoman provinces of **Bosnia and Herzegovina.** These provinces were also **coveted by Serbia** which had the backing of Russia in establishing a united Slav state in the Balkans. Russia threatened to start a war against Austrian annexation but **Germany’s open support to Austria compelled Russia to retreat**. The incident, however, not only embittered feelings in Serbia but also created further enmity between Russia and Germany.
        3. **First Balkan War (1912):** Serbia, Greece, Montenegro & Bulgaria **launched series of attacks on Turkey and captured most of the remaining Turkish territory** of Europe. Serbs weren't happy with the resulting settlement, **Albania** was given independence (which Serbs wanted - to have an outlet to the sea) as per a **deliberate move by Austria.**
        4. Second Balkan War (1913): Bulgarians weren't happy with settlement either and they **blamed Serbia.** Greece, Romania, Turkey rallied to **support Serbia when Bulgaria attacked**; and were made to **forfeit their gains from first war**. Anglo-German influence prevented escalation of war by **restraining the Austrians (who wanted to attack Serbs)**. Consequences - Serbia strengthened and **determined to take Bosnia**, Austria equally determined to **end Serbia's ambitions.**
    6. Finally, the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand: On 28 June 1914, heir to the Emperor Franz Josef of Habsburg empire, Franz Ferdinand, was shot dead by **Serb terrorist Gavrilo Princip.** Austrians blamed **Serbian govt and sent a harsh ultimatum.** Serbs accepted most of the demands but the Austrians, with a promise of German support, **used this as an excuse to declare war on Serbia.** Russia, determined to **not let Serbs down again,** ordered a general mobilization of the army. Germany asked them to back down but when they didn't comply, **declared war on Russia (Aug 1) and on France (Aug 3).** Germany entered **Belgium to invade France, Britain enters war next day (Aug 4)**. Austria-Hungary **declared war on Russia (Aug 6).** Italy and Japan joined in later from Allied side in hope of **gaining territories from Austria and Germany (in China) respectively.**
    7. First World War - most expected it to be a short war **like other European wars**. Germans failed to achieve rapid defeat of France and **led to trench warfare for the rest of the war years**. East front had more movement, with early Russian successes **against Austrians who had to be constantly helped out by the Germans.** Germany eventually **forced Russia out of war** by end of Dec 1917. France and Britain were on verge of defeat but the **entry of USA in April 1917 turned it in favour of the Allies**. British naval blockade of **German ports and defeating of submarine threats** was also telling on Germans. Eventually an armistice was signed on 11 November 1918 **though Germany had hardly been invaded.** ￼Allies - Italy (May 1915), Romania (Aug 1916), USA (Apr 1917)￼Central - Turkey (Nov 1914), Bulgaria (Oct 1915).
        
        1. Western front - **Schlieffen Plan** didn't materialize due to **strong push back by Belgium** and **Battle of Marne** proved decisive -
            
            1. Hope of short war dashed, Germany has full scale war on 2 fronts, **trench warfare from coast to Alps**, bought British navy time to bring **crippling blockade on Germany**
            2. 1916 - **Battle of Verdun** (Feb-Jun, heavy casualty and **no gains by either sides**) and **Battle of Somme** (Jul-Nov, British trying to relieve pressure at Verdun and succeeded in **deflating German morale**). Both battles are important because they to **led heavy loss of lives, criticism of army tactics, change of PM** (Asquith -> Lloyd George). 1917 - mutiny in French military, success of battle tanks (Battle of Cambrai) which became model of Allied attack. **Lloyd George & Clemenceau team up and rally the wilting Allies.**
        2. Eastern front - Russians made the **mistake of invading Austria and Germany** at the same time, however **lost to Germany every time they clashed**. Russians had the largest standing army but **not enough arms and ammunition**. Turkey cut their supply route via Black Sea.
            
            1. 1915 - British and French tried to help (**Gallipoli campaign) unsuccessfully**. Bulgaria entered the war and **overran Serbia with German help.** Italy declared war from Allied side in hope of gaining territory. **1916 - Germany took Romania and their oil and wheat supply.**
            2. 1917 - Russian withdrawal due to heavy losses, lack of arms and supplies, problems of transport and communication and utterly incompetent leadership causing 2 revolutions. **Bolsheviks come into power and willing to make peace.** Entire German force shifts to western front. British **captures Baghdad and Jerusalem, gaining control of vast oil supplies.**
        3. War at Sea - Allied used **navy for Central power blockades to starve them out,** keep their trade routes open & **transport troops and supplies**. No direct confrontation of **Dreadnoughts** other than Battle of Jutland (1916) with indecisive results but Germans embarking on **'unrestricted' submarine warfare.**
            
            1. This eventually **brought USA into war** as it was hampering their trade interests and lives of Americans, along with the discovery that German was persuading Mexico to attack USA **(Zimmermann Telegram**) and gain territories + Russian withdrawal from the Allied side.￼German U-boats sank British passenger liner as it was carrying vast quantities of weapons, in which some Americans died, **forcing American protests which meant German submarine blockade wasn’t as effective**.
    8. German armistice -
        
        1. Britain, France and USA launched a **military offensive in July 1918 and Germany and her allies began to collapse.** Bulgaria withdrew from the war in September, and Turkey surrendered in October.
        2. Germany went for **final offensive** before American troops arrive and domestic discontent with war leads to revolution. They almost pulled it off but **French managed to hold off and launched a counter offensive** which forced the Germans to withdraw their entire line **(disease + low morale).**
        3. Political **discontent** had been rising in Austria-Hungary  and Germany. The emperor of Austria-Hungary  surrendered on 3 November. In Germany **revolution broke out**. Germany became a **republic and the German emperor Kaiser William II** fled to Holland. New German government signed an armistice on 11 November 1918 hoping to **get less severe terms** based on **Wilson's 14 Points.** The war was over.
        4. Main countries involved in war **had war aims which they were determined to achieve**, which were competing in nature and would mean that an **accepted negotiable solution will be impossible to reach.**
    9. Why Central powers lost?￼Failure of **Schlieffen Plan**, naval **blockade** by Allies, failure of German **submarine** campaign (also got USA involved), **entry of USA** and its resources, **competent leadership** of Lloyd George and Clemenceau vs Central powers, continuous strain of **heavy losses** on Germans, and **weakness of German** allies.
    10. In January 1918, Woodrow Wilson had **proposed a peace program, known as Fourteen Points**. These included the **conduct of negotiations** between states openly, freedom of navigation, reduction of armaments, independence of Belgium, restoration of Alsace Lorraine to France, creation of independent states in Europe, formation of an international organization to guarantee the independence of all states, etc. Some of these points were **accepted when the peace treaties were signed at the end of the war**
    ![Image result for wilson 14 points](Exported%20image%2020250424103735-5.jpeg)12. Peace treaties -  Though the number of countries represented at the **conference was 27**, the terms of the peace treaties were really decided by **three countries — Britain, France and USA.**
        
        1. The three persons who played the determining role in framing the terms of the treaties were Woodrow **Wilson** (USA), Lloyd **George**, (Britain), and George **Clemenceau** (France). The defeated countries were **not represented** at the conference. Russia was also excluded. Terms of the treaty were thus not the result of negotiations but were **imposed on the defeated by the victors.**
    13. **Treaty of Versailles** - main treaty was signed with Germany on 28 June 1919. Republican government of **Germany was compelled** to sign this treaty under the threat of invasion.
        
        1. Treaty declared Germany and her allies **guilty of aggression**. Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France. Perhaps the most humiliating portion of the treaty for the **defeated Germany was** **Article 231****,** commonly known as the "War Guilt Clause," which forced Germany to **accept complete responsibility** for initiating World War I.
        2. The coal mines in the German area called **Saar were ceded to France for 15 years** while that area was to be governed by the League of Nations.
        3. Germany also ceded **parts of her pre-war territory** to Denmark, Belgium, Poland and Czechoslovakia. The area of the **Rhine valley was to be demilitarized.**
        4. Also contained provisions for **disarming Germany**. The strength of her army was to be limited to **100,000** and she was required **not to have any air force and submarines.**
        5. Dispossessed of **all her colonies** which were taken over by the victors.
    14. Treaty of **Saint-Germain**-en-Laye & Trianon - Austria-Hungary was **broken up** and Austria was required to recognize the independence of **Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Poland**. Had to **cede territories to them and to Italy**. Many changes were made in the Balkans where new states were created and transfers of territories from one state to another took place.
    15. Treaty of **Sevres**-  treaty with **Turkey** stipulated the complete **dismemberment of the Ottoman empire.** Britain was given **Palestine and Mesopotamia** (Iraq) and Syria and Lebanon went to **France** as what were called ‘mandates’.  Most of the remaining Turkish territories were to be given to **Greece** and Italy, and Turkey was to be reduced to a very small state.
        
        1. However, there was a **revolution** in Turkey under the leadership of **Mustafa Kemal**. The Sultan was deposed and Turkey was **proclaimed a republic in 1922**. Turkey regained control of Asia Minor and the city of Constantinople and the **Allies were forced to abandon the earlier treaty.**
    16. League of Nations - An important part of the peace treaties was the **Covenant of the League of Nations**. Wilson’s Fourteen Points included the creation of an international organization for the preservation of peace and to **guarantee the independence of all states.** The League of Nations was created.
        
        1. It was intended as a **world organization of all independent states**. It aimed at the preservation of peace and security and peaceful settlement of international conflicts, and bound its members **‘not to resort to war’**
        2. One of its important provisions was with **regard to sanctions**. According to this provision, **economic and military action** would be taken against any country which committed aggression.
        3. It also bound its members to **improve labor and social conditions** in their countries. For this the International Labor Organization was set up which is now one of the specialized agencies of the United Nations.
    17. Hopes of having a truly world organization **devoted to the preservation of peace and independence of nations** were, however, not realized with the formation of the League.
        
        1. Two major countries – Germany and the Soviet Union — were **not allowed to become its members** for many years, while India, which was not independent, was **made a member.**
        2. USA which had played an important part in the setting up of the League **ultimately decided not to join it**. League was never an effective organization. In the 1930s when many countries resorted to aggression, the League was **either ignored or defied.**
    
    Allies had entered into **many secret agreements** for dividing the spoils of war. Soviet government, to bring out the imperialist nature of the war, **made these treaties public**. During the war, the Allies had been claiming that the war was being fought for **freedom and democracy.** President Wilson had said that the war was being fought **“to make the world safe for democracy”.** The publication of secret treaties by the Soviet government **exposed these claims (**Sykes–Picot agreement)**.** However, in spite of this, the distribution of the colonies of the defeated countries among the victors took place.￼
    
11. Russian Revolution
    
    1. Conditions prior - By the early years of 20th century, political movements based on the **ideas of socialism had emerged in a number of countries in Europe**. With WW1, socialist movement in most countries of Europe **suffered a setback**. Second International faced a split on the question of attitude to the War and ceased to function.
        
        1. Russia was still living in **‘the old world’ under the autocratic rule of the Tsars.** Serfdom had been **abolished in 1861, but it did not improve** the condition of peasants. They still had miserably small holdings of land with **no capital to develop** even these. For the small holdings they acquired, they had to pay **heavy redemption dues for decades**. Land hunger of the peasants was a major social factor in the Russian society.
        2. Industrialization began **very late in Russia**, in the second half of the 19th century. Then it developed at a fairly fast rate, but more than **half of the capital for investment came from foreign countries.** Foreign investors were interested in quick profits and showed no concern for the conditions of workers. Russian capitalists, with insufficient capital, competed with foreign investors **by reducing workers’ wages**
        3. Words of Marx that **workers have ‘nothing to lose but their chains’** rang literally true to them
        4. Russian state under the Czars was **completely unsuited to the needs of modern times**. Tsar Nicholas II still believed in the **divine right of kings**. Preservation of **absolutism** was regarded by him as a sacred duty. Only people who supported the Czar were the **nobility and the upper layers of the clergy**
        5. Russian Tsars had built a **vast empire by conquest of diverse nationalities in Europe and Asia.** In these conquered areas, they imposed the **use of the Russian language and tried to belittle** the cultures of the people of these areas. Russia’s imperialist expansion brought her into **conflicts with other imperialist powers.**
    2. Growth of revolutionary movements
        
        1. There were many peasant rebellions in Russia **before** the 19th century but they were **suppressed**. Many Russian thinkers had been **influenced by developments in Western Europe** and wanted to see similar changes in Russia. Their efforts had helped to bring about the **abolition of serfdom.** This, however, turned out to be a hollow victory. In the last quarter of 19th century, there was a movement known as **‘going to the people’ when intellectuals started preaching their ideas to the peasants.**
        2. When the workers’ organizations were set up after industrialization began, they were **dominated by ideas of socialism**. In 1883, the **Russian Social Democratic Party** was formed by **Georgi Plekhanov,** a follower of Marx. This party along with many other socialist groups was united into the **Russian Social Democratic Labour Party** in 1898. However, the party was soon **split** over questions of organization and policy.
        3. One group which was in a **minority (hence known as the Mensheviks)** favored a party of the type that existed in countries like France and Germany and **participated in elections to the parliaments** of their countries.
        4. The majority, known as the **Bolsheviks**, were convinced that in a country **where no democratic rights existed and where there was no parliament,** a party organized on parliamentary lines would not be effective. They favored a party of those who would abide by the discipline of the party and **work for revolution.**
        5. Leader of the Bolsheviks was **Vladimir Lenin**. He is regarded as one of the greatest leaders of the **socialist movement after Marx and Engels**. He devoted himself to the task of organizing the **Bolshevik Party as an instrument** for bringing about revolution. Russian socialists, including Plekhanov and Lenin, had played an important **part in the Second International.**
    3. **1905 revolution** - Revolutionary movement in Russia had been growing when the 1905 Revolution broke out.
        
        1. In 1904, a war had broken out between Russia and Japan which **ended in Russian defeat.** This had further **strengthened** the revolutionary movement in Russia. In January 1905, a **mass of peaceful workers** with their wives and children was **fired at in St. Petersburg** while on its way to the Winter Palace to present a petition to the Tsar. More than a thousand of them were killed and thousands of others were wounded. This day is known as **"Bloody Sunday"**. The news of the killings provoked **unprecedented disturbances throughout Russia.** Even sections of the army and the navy revolted. 
        2. A **new form of organization** developed in this revolution which proved decisive in the upheaval of 1917. This was the ‘Soviet’, or the **council of workers’ representatives**. Beginning as **committees to conduct strikes**, they became the instruments of political power. Soviets of peasants were also formed.
        3. Tsar yielded and announced his manifesto **granting freedom of speech, press and association, and conferred the power to make laws upon an elected body called the ‘Duma’**. Tsar’s manifesto contained principles which would have made Russia a **constitutional monarchy** like England. However, the Czar soon **relapsed** into his old ways. No longer could one hope for gradual reform.
    4. Causes of 1917 revolution -
        
        1. Hoping to satisfy his **imperial ambitions by annexing Constantinople** and the Straits of the **Dardanelles**, the Tsar took Russia into the First World War. This proved **fatal and brought about the final breakdown** of the Russian autocracy. The Czarist state was incapable of carrying on a modern war.
        2. The **decadence of the royal family** made matters worse, Nicholas II was completely dominated by his wife, **Alexandra Feodorovna**. She, in turn, was deeply influenced by a mystic named **Rasputin** who virtually ran the government.
        3. Corruption in the state **resulted in great suffering** among the people. Government was completely unmindful of the conditions of soldiers on the front. By 1917, **600,000 soldiers had been killed** in war. There was widespread discontent throughout the empire as well as in the army. The condition was ripe for a revolution.
        4. In setting forth the fundamental law for a successful revolution, Lenin had included two conditions - the people should **fully understand that revolution is necessary** and be ready to sacrifice their lives for it AND the existing government should be in a **state of crisis to make it possible** for it to be overthrown rapidly. That tune had certainly arrived in Russia in 1917.
    5. February Revolution 1917 - Minor incidents usually set off revolutions. In the case of the Russian Revolution it was a **demonstration by working-class women trying to purchase bread.** A general strike of workers followed, in which soldiers and others soon joined. On 12 March 1917 the capital city of **St. Petersburg fell into the hands of the revolutionaries.** Soon the revolutionaries took Moscow, the Tsar gave up his throne and the **first Provisional Government** was formed on 15 March.
    6. The most important demands of the people were fourfold: **peace**, land to the **tiller**, control of **industry by workers,** and equal **status for the non-Russian** nationalities. The Provisional Government under the leadership of Alexander **Kerensky** **did not implement** any of these demands and lost the support of the people. Lenin, who was in **exile in Switzerland** at the time of the February Revolution, returned to Russia in April. Under his leadership, the **Bolshevik Party** put forward clear policies
        
        1. to **end the war**
        2. **transfer land to the peasants** and advanced the slogan ‘All Power to the Soviets’.
        3. Lenin had described the Russian empire as a **‘prison of nations**’ and had declared that no genuine democracy could be established unless all **non-Russian peoples were given equal rights.** He had proclaimed the right of all peoples, including those under the Russian empire, to **self-determination.**
    
    Unpopularity of the Kerensky government led to its collapse on 7 November 1917, when a group of **sailors occupied the Winter Palace**, the seat of the Kerensky government.  
    **Leon Trotsky** who had played an important role in the 1905 Revolution returned to Russia in May 1917. As head of the **Petrograd Soviet**, he was one of the most outstanding leaders of the **November uprising**. An All Russian **Congress of Soviets** met on the same day and assumed full political power. This event which took place on 7 November is known as the **October Revolution**
    
    8. Congress of Soviets on the next day issued a **proclamation to all peoples and belligerent states** to open negotiations for a **just peace** without annexation and indemnities.
        
        1. Russia **withdrew from the war**, though formal peace was signed with Germany later, after ceding the territories that **Germany demanded as a price for peace**.
        2. Following the decree on land, the **estates of the landlords, the Church and the Tsar were confiscated and transferred to peasants’ societies** to be allotted to peasant families to be cultivated without hired labor.
        3. Control of industries was **transferred to shop committees** of workers. By the middle of 1918, banks and insurance companies, large industries, mines, water transport and railways were **nationalized**, foreign debts were repudiated and foreign investments were **confiscated.**
        4. A **Declaration of the Rights of Peoples** was issued conferring the right of self-determination upon all nationalities.
        5. A new government, called the **Council of People’s Commissars**, headed by Lenin was formed. These first acts of the new government were hailed as the **beginning of the era of socialism.**
    9. October Revolution had been **almost completely peaceful.** However, soon the new state was involved in a **civil war.** The officers of the **army of the fallen Tsar** organized an armed rebellion against the Soviet state. Troops of **foreign powers — England, France, Japan, United States and other —joined them as new govt has refused to honor debts** of Russian Empire. War raged till 1920. By this time the **‘Red Army’ of the new state** was in control of almost all the lands of the old Tsarist empire. **Red Army was badly equipped** and composed mainly of workers and peasants. However, it won over better equipped and better trained forces
    10. Consequences -
        
        1. **Overthrow of autocracy** and the **destruction of the aristocracy** and the **power of the church** were the first achievements of the Russian Revolution.
        2. Empire was transformed into a new state called the **Union of Soviet Socialist Republics** (U.S.S.R), for short Soviet Union. 
        3. Policies of the new state were to be directed to the realization of the old socialist ideal, **‘from each according to his capacity, to each according to his work’**. 
        4. Private property in the means of production was **abolished** and the motive of **private profit eliminated** from the system of production. Economic planning by the state was adopted to build a **technologically advanced economy at a fast rate** and to eliminate glaring inequalities in society
        5. Right to work became a **constitutional right** and it became the duty of the state to provide employment to every individual. **Education of the entire people** was given a high priority.
        6. Equality of **all the nationalities in the U S S.R. was recognized** in the constitution framed in 1924 and later in 1936. The constitution gave the republics formed by the nationalities **autonomy to develop** their languages and cultures.
    
    In its impact on the world, the Russian Revolution **had few parallels in history**. The ideas of socialism which the socialist movement had been advocating and which the Russian Revolution espoused were **intended for universal application**. It was the first successful revolution in history which proclaimed the building of a socialist society as its objective.
    
    12. **Comintern (1919-43)** - **Communist International (also known as the Third International** or Comintern) was formed for **promoting revolutions** on an international scale. Leftwing sections in many socialist parties now **formed themselves into communist parties** and they affiliated themselves to the **Comintern**.
        
        1.  Communist parties were also formed in other countries, often with the **active involvement and support of the Comintern.** Thus the international communist movement arose under one organization which decided on policies to be followed by **all communist parties**
        2. With the formation of the Comintern, the **socialist movement was divided into two sections — socialist and communist.** There were many differences between them on the methods of bringing about socialism and about the concept of socialism itself.
        3. Despite these differences, socialism became one of the **most widely held ideologies** within a few decades after its emergence. The spread of the **influence of socialist ideas** and movements was in no small measure due to the **success** of the Russian Revolution.
        4. Growing popularity of socialism and many achievements made by the Soviet Union **led to a redefinition of democracy**. Most people who did not believe in socialism also began to recognize that for democracy to be real, **political rights without social and economic rights were not enough.** Economic and social affairs could **not be left to the capitalists**. Popularity of socialism also helped to **mitigate discriminations** based on race, colour and sex.
        
        1. New Soviet state came to be looked upon as a **friend of the peoples of the colonies** struggling for national independence. Russia after the Revolution was the **first country in Europe to openly support** the cause of independence of all nations from foreign rule.￼
12. Between WW1 and WW2
    
    1. Europe bw wars - Germany was proclaimed a **republic**, which didn't satisfy some revolutionaries. Two socialist leaders, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, were assassinated. Inspired by the Russian Revolution, there were **revolutions in many other countries** of Europe such as Hungary, Finland, and Baltic States of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania which had earlier been parts of the Russian empire. But all these revolutions were **short lived**. Political situation in almost every country in Europe was complicated. This period saw the **growth of socialist and communist par ties** in almost every country of Europe. However, within a few years in many countries of Europe, the **socialist movements were defeated and dictatorial governments** came to power.
    2. Fascism in Italy - number of political movements which arose in Europe **after the WW1 are generally given the name ‘fascist’** . Common features of these movements were their hostility to **democracy and socialism**, and the aim of establishing dictatorships.
        
        1. They succeeded, in **many countries of Europe,** such as, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Germany, Spain.
        2. **Fascism movement** started in Italy under the leadership of Benito **Mussolini**. Mussolini had organized **armed gangs against socialists and communists** in 1919. Italy had joined WW1 with the aim of gaining colonies. However, the peace treaties had failed to satisfy its ambitions.
        3. Italian government at the time was **dominated by capitalists and landlords** who began to support **anti-democratic movements** which promised to save them from the danger of socialism as well as to satisfy their colonial aspirations.
        4. Movement started by Mussolini was one such movement. His armed gangs were used by landlords and industrialists to **organize violence against socialists and communists.** A systematic **campaign of terrorism and murder** was launched but the government showed little interest in curbing it.
        5. In 1921, elections were held in Italy. Socialists and communists won 138 seats and **Mussolini's party could get only 38. However he marched on Rome in 1922 and seized power - without firing a shot.**
        6. Victory of fascism in Italy was neither the result of a victory in elections nor of a popular uprising. The government of Italy was **handed over to the fascists** because the ruling classes of Italy considered **democracy and socialism as threats to their power**.
        7. Takeover of the government by fascists was followed by a reign of terror. **Socialist and communist movement was suppressed**. In 1926 all political parties except Mussolini’s party were banned. Fascists believed that there could be **no harmony between two or more nations**. They glorified war which, according to them, "**ennobled people".** Openly advocated a policy of expansion and said that nations which do not expand cannot survive for long.
    3. Nazism in Germany - Germany had sought to satisfy her imperial ambitions through WW1 but suffered defeat. Outbreak of revolution in Germany towards the end of the WW1 led to the **collapse of the German monarchy**. However, even though Germany became a republic, the forces behind the monarchy the **industrialists, the big landowners and the officers of the army remained quite powerful**. Govt was not able to destroy their power. These forces began to turn to the **anti-democratic forces represented by Nazism to extend their power** and to check the power of the socialist movement.
        
        1. Adolf Hitler too tried to capture power through a march on Berlin, but was **captured and jailed**. **Beer Hall Putsch of Munich** in Nov 1923 - gave Hitler recognition worldwide, time to write in jail where he wrote **Mein Kampf** and moved him to change tactics of Nazi party to capture **power through legitimate means**. In Mein Kampf, he expressed some of the most monstrous ideas of the Nazi movement.
        2. He glorified the use of **force and brutality**, and the rule by a great leader and **ridiculed internationalism, peace and democracy**. He preached extreme hatred against the German Jews who were **blamed not only for the defeat** of Germany in WW1 but for **all the ills of Germany**. He glorified violent nationalism and extolled war.
        3. These ideas of the Nazis **found favor with the army, the industrialists, the big landowners and the anti republican politicians**. They began to look upon Hitler as the savior of Germany.
        4. Nazis capitalized on the **sense of humiliation which many Germans felt** at their defeat in the war and the unjust provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. They also exploited the **misery of the people which had worsened** due to the reparations which Germany was made to pay to the Allied powers. In 1929 occurred the most serious economic crisis which affected all the capitalist countries of the world.
        5. As a result of this crisis, **8 million workers**, about half of the working population of Germany, were **rendered unemployed**. It was during this period that the Nazi Party, which was no more than a conspiratorial group in the beginning, began to spread its influence. Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party were powerful parties with huge following, however, **failed to unite against the Nazis.**
        6. In the elections held in Germany before Hitler came to power, Nazi Party had polled less votes than the Socialist and Communist vote put together. It had won only 196 seats out of a total of about 650. Hitler’s coming to power was the result of political intrigues.
        7. In spite of his poor showing in the elections, **Hitler was appointed the Chancellor** of Germany by the President of Germany in Jan 1933. Soon after coming to power, Hitler **ordered fresh elections and let loose a reign of terror**. Assassination of anti-Nazi leaders was organized on a large scale. In Feb 1933, the Reichstag building was set on fire by the Nazis. **Communist** Party Germany was **blamed** for the fire and was **suppressed**. In spite of the terror organized by the Nazis, the Nazi Party could **not win a majority** of seats in Parliament. However, Hitler **assumed dictatorial powers (Enabling Act)** and, in 1934, became the President.
        8. Trade unions were **suppressed** and thousands of **socialists, communists and anti-Nazi political leaders** were exterminated. The Nazis started **huge bonfires** into which the works of some of the best writers of Germany and other countries were thrown. Besides socialists and communists, **Jews were made victims of an organized campaign** of humiliation and violence
    4. USA - One of the most important features of the period after WW1 was the **decline in the supremacy of Europe** in the  world and the growing importance of the United States of America. Emerged as the r**ichest and the most powerful country** in the world at the end of the war. This was clear from the important role that she played during the framing of the peace treaties.
        
        1. Had made **tremendous industrial progress** and was beginning to make heavy investments in Europe. However, in spite of this progress, the USA was frequently beset with serious economic problems.
    5. Great Depression - lasted from 1929 to 1939, and was the **worst economic downturn** in the history of the industrialized world.
        
        1. It began after the **stock market crash of 29 October 1929 (Black Tuesday),** which sent Wall Street into a panic and **wiped out millions of investors and 9000 banks**. Since banks were **uninsured**, people lost **all their life savings.** Half the banks that survived **weren't willing to extend loans** leading to downturn in investment.
        2. Roaring 20s - **Throughout the 1920s**, the U.S. economy expanded rapidly, and the nation’s **total wealth more than doubled between 1920 and 1929**. New York Stock Exchange was scene of **reckless speculation**, where everyone from **millionaire tycoons to cooks and janitors poured their savings into stocks**. As a result, the stock market underwent rapid expansion, reaching its peak in August 1929.
        3. By then, production had **already declined and unemployment had risen**, leaving stock prices much higher than their actual value. Additionally, **wages at that time were low, consumer debt was increasing, the agricultural sector of the economy was struggling due to drought and falling food prices, and banks had an excess of large loans** that could not be liquidated.
        4. American economy entered a mild recession during the summer of 1929, as consumer spending slowed and unsold goods began to pile up, which in turn slowed factory production. Nonetheless, stock prices continued to rise, and by the fall of that year had reached stratospheric levels that could **not be justified by expected** future earnings.
        5. As consumer confidence **vanished i**n the wake of the stock market crash, the downturn in **spending and investment led factories and other businesses to slow down production** and begin firing their workers. For those who were lucky enough to remain employed, **wages fell and buying power decreased.**
        6. Many Americans forced to buy on credit **fell into debt, and the number of foreclosures and repossessions climbed steadily.** The global adherence to the gold standard, which joined countries around the world in a fixed currency exchange, **helped spread economic woes from USA to throughout the world, especially Europe.**
        7. Meanwhile, the country’s industrial production **had dropped by half**. Bread lines, soup kitchens and rising numbers of homeless people became more and more common in America’s towns and cities. In previous depressions, farmers were usually safe from the severe effects of a depression because **they could at least feed themselves**. Unfortunately, during the Great Depression, the Great Plains were hit hard with both a **drought and horrendous dust storms, creating what became known as the Dust Bowl**. When the dust storms damaged the crops, not only could the small farmer not feed himself and his family, he could **not pay back his debt taken for cropping**. Banks would then foreclose on the small farms and the farmer's family would be **both homeless and unemployed.**
        8. U.S. economy broke down and entered the Great Depression during the **presidency of Herbert Hoover**. Although President Hoover repeatedly spoke of optimism, the people **blamed him for the Great Depression.** As soon as Roosevelt took office, he **closed all the banks** and only let them **reopen once they were stabilized.** Next, Roosevelt began to establish programs that became known as the **New Deal**. Major turn-around for the U.S. economy occurred **after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the entrance of the United States into World War II.** Once the U.S. was involved in the war, both people and industry became **essential to the war effort.** Weapons, artillery, ships, and airplanes were needed quickly. Men were trained to become soldiers and the women were kept on the home front to keep the factories going.
    6. Emergence of Soviet Union - period after WW1 saw **emergence of the Soviet Union as a major power** and she began to play a crucial role in world affairs. Military intervention by Britain, France, USA and Japan **in Russia in support of the counterrevolutionary forces** has already been mentioned. By 1920 the counterrevolutionary forces had been defeated and the **foreign armies driven out.**
        
        1. The period of civil war was of acute economic distress for people. In 1921, the **New Economic Policy was introduced.** Under this policy, the peasants were allowed to sell their produce in the open markets, payment of wages in cash was reintroduced and production of goods and their sale in some industries under private control was permitted. A few years later, in 1929, the USSR started its **vigorous program of economic reconstruction** and industrialization when it adopted the **first of a series of its Five Year Plans.**
        2. Within a few years, the Soviet Union **emerged as a major industrial power**. The extraordinary economic progress that the Soviet Union achieved **was against heavy odds**. Though the foreign intervention had been ended, many countries of Europe, and the United States followed a **policy of economic boycott with the aim of destroying the revolution.**
        3. However, the Soviet Union not only survived but continued to grow economically at a fast rate**. Only country which remained unaffected by the economic crisis of 1929-33**. On the contrary, its industrial development went on as before while **millions of people in West were unemployed** and thousands of factories had come to a standstill.
        4. Soviets adopted the policy of **promoting** **collective farms**. In these farms, individual **ownership of farms by peasants** was ended and the peasants worked on these ‘collective farms’ collectively. The government pursued the policy of **collectivization vigorously** and by 1937 almost all cultivable land was brought under collective farms. Initially, the peasants were free to decide whether they wanted to join the collective farms or not. Later, they were **forced to join**. The rich peasants who opposed collectivization were severely dealt with. The process of collectivization of agriculture was accompanied by many atrocities. According to some estimates, **millions of people perished in this period.**
    7. Stalin - After the death of Lenin in 1924 many serious differences arose within the ruling Communist Party the **only political party which existed** — over policies to be followed. There was also serious struggle for power between different groups and individual leaders. In this struggle, **Stalin emerged victorious.**
        
        1. In 1927, Trotsky who had played an important role in the revolution and had organized the Red Army was **expelled from the Communist Party**. In 1929, he was sent into exile.
        2. In the 1930s, almost all the leaders who had played an important role in the revolution and in the following years were eliminated. False charges were **brought against them,** and after fake trials they were executed. **Political democracy and freedom of speech and press were destroyed.** The expression of differences even within the party was not tolerated.
        3. Stalin, who had been the General Secretary of the Communist Party, **assumed dictatorial powers which he exercised till his death in 1953**. These developments had an **adverse** effect on the building of socialism in the USSR and introduced features which were **contrary to the humanistic ideals of Marxism and of the revolution**. The development of art and literature also suffered because of restrictions on freedom.
    8. Soviet Union was **not recognized by most European powers and USA** for a long time. However, with its growing strength she could not be ignored and gradually one country after another recognized her. Britain **established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1933.** In 1934 she also became a member of the League of Nations.
        
        1. However, in spite of the ending of the isolation of the Soviet Union, the **hostility towards the Soviet Union continued.** The Soviet Union followed a policy of support to the movements for independence. The help given to China is notable in this context. When the fascist countries started their acts of aggression, the Soviet government **pressed for action against them.**
        2. However, the Western countries did not agree to the Soviet proposals. They continued to regard the **Soviet Union as a danger to them** and **hoped** that fascist countries would destroy her. Their **hostility to the Soviet Union led to the appeasement of fascist powers** and paved the way for the Second World War.
    9. Turkey - The nationalist movement in Turkey was organized to **prevent the domination of the country by the Allied powers and the annexation of parts of Turkey by Greece and Italy**. The Sultan of Turkey agreed to the terms dictated by the Allied powers.
        
        1. However, even before the treaty was signed by the Sultan, a national government had been **established under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal** with its headquarters at Ankara. This government signed a **treaty of friendship with the Soviet government in 1921** under which Turkey received Soviet political support and arms for the nationalist cause.
        2. Following the treaty with the Sultan, Turkey had been **invaded by Greece.** The Turks under Kemal’s leadership were able to **repel the invasion and the Allies were forced to repudiate the earlier treaty.** The Allied troops were **withdrawn from Turkish territory** and the areas which were to be annexed by European countries remained in Turkey. Thus Turkey was able to **win her complete independence.**
        3. The success of the Turks in winning the complete independence of their country was followed by a program to **modernize Turkey and to end the influence of backward looking feudal elements.** Turkey was proclaimed a republic.
    10. China - In 1911, there was a revolution in China which resulted in the **establishment of a republic**. However, power passed into the **hands of corrupt warlords (Beiyang army factions).**
        
        1. National movement in China aimed at the **overthrow of foreign domination** and the **unification of China** by ending the rule of the warlords. The founder of the **national movement in China was Dr. Sun Yat Sen.** He had played an important role in the 1911 **Xinhai revolution which overthrew the Qing dynasty** and in 1917 had set up a government at **Canton in south China.** The party formed by him called **Kuomintang** led the national struggle in China for a number of years.
        2. New government in Russia had **renounced all the unequal treaties which the Russian emperors had imposed on China** and had promised full support to the Chinese national struggle. In 1921 the **Communist Party of China was formed.** In 1924, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party decided to **work together** and the Soviet government gave various kinds of aid, such as the training of a revolutionary army.
        3. A number of Soviet political and military advisers worked with the **Chinese liberation movement.** After the death of Sun Yat Sen in 1925, the unity between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was **broken and a period of civil war began.**
        4. In the 1930s when the Japanese attacked China with the aim of subjugating the entire country, the two **parties agreed to work togethe**r to resist the Japanese invasion. Communist Party played a **leading role in the war of resistance against the Japanese invasion.** It was able to establish its supremacy in the country and within a few years after the **end of the WW2 was victorious in the civil war.**
    11. Africa - Though the struggles for national independence in **Africa gained momentum after WW2,** the 1920s and the 1930s were a period when the **first political associations were formed.** #important
        
        1. An important role in the growth of national consciousness in Africa was played by a **series of** **Pan-African Congresses.** Pan African movement **asserted the identity and unity of the African people**, and independence of Africa.
        2. National movement in **South Africa had emerged earlier** than in other parts of Africa. In 1912 the **African National Congress** had been formed which became the leading organization of the South African people.
        3. Ethiopia fought **heroically against the Italian invasion 1935-36** and their resistance served as a source of **inspiration** to the people of Africa.
    12. Beginning of aggression - In the 1930s the **fascist powers began their wars of conquest** which ultimately led to the WW2. Major fascist countries were Italy and Germany who **got an ally in the militarist regime which came to power in Japan.**
        
        1. These three countries started **series of aggressions in Europe, Asia and Africa**. All of them claimed to have been **fighting against communism** and were united in **1937** under the **Anti-Comintern Pact.**
        2. When the acts of aggression began, the aggrieved countries, the Soviet Union and many leaders in different countries **demanded collective action to defeat the aggressions**. In 1935, the Communist International advocated the **formation of Popular Fronts consisting of Communists, Socialists and other antifascists** to counter the danger of fascism and war.
        3. Hitler had come to power in Germany because the Communist and Social Democratic Parties of Germany had **failed to unite against the Nazis**. Comintern’s advocacy of uniting all antifascist forces was followed by the **formation of Popular Fronts** in many countries. In France, the **Popular Front succeeded** in preventing a fascist takeover.
        4. Covenant of the League of Nations contained a **provision for economic and military sanctions and** **collective action** **against aggression**. However, the Western governments, instead of resisting the aggressions, followed a policy of **appeasement of the aggressive powers.**
        5. Since the success of the Russian Revolution, the Western countries had been **haunted by the danger of communism** and they hoped that fascist countries would rid them of this danger.
    13. Japanese invasion of China - One of the first major acts of aggression after the First World War was the **Japanese invasion of China in 1931**. Minor incident involving a railway line owned by the Japanese in Manchuria was made the pretext for the invasion.
        
        1. China, a member of the League of Nations, **appealed to the League for sanctions against Japan to stop the aggression**. However, Britain and France, the leading countries in the League, were **completely indifferent** to the appeal and acquiesced in the aggression.
        2. Japan occupied **Manchuria, installed a puppet government** there and proceeded to conquer more areas. In 1933, Japan quit the League of Nations. Western countries thought that the Japanese could be used to **weaken China as well as the Soviet Union**.
    14. German re-militarization
        
        1. Germany had been admitted to the League of Nations some time after its formation but soon after Hitler came to power, he **quit the League and undertook a massive program of militarization.**
        2. According to the **Treaty of Versailles, severe restrictions** had been imposed on the military strength of Germany. The beginning of German remilitarization in violation of the Treaty created a sense of **insecurity in many countries, particularly France**. It was in this situation that the Soviet Union became a **member of the League in 1934.** As Germany remilitarized Rhineland and other areas, alarming the French, **nothing was done to stop this.**
    15. **Spanish Civil War** - In 1931 Spain had become a republic. In 1936 a **Popular Front comprising the Socialist, Communist and other democratic** and antifascist parties came to power. A section of the army under the leadership of **General Francisco Franco** with the armed support of Italy and Germany **revolted against the government.**
        
        1. Italy and Germany started **intervening openly in the Civil War** that followed. They sent forces, tanks and warships in support of the rebels. The German aircrafts conducted air raids on Spanish towns and villages.
        2. Government of the Spanish Republic **appealed for help against the fascists**. Only the Soviet Union came to the help of the Republican forces. Britain and France advocated a policy of nonintervention and **refused to give any aid to the government of Spain**. They remained indifferent to the German and Italian intervention in the war.
    16. Munich Pact - While the Spanish Civil War was still going on, Hitler’s troops **marched into Austria in March 1938 and occupied it.**
        
        1. Even though this was a violation of the peace treaties signed after WW1, Western powers did not protest against it. **Final act of appeasement of fascism by the Western powers was the** **Munich Pact.**
        2. Germany coveted Czechoslovakia which was very important **because of its industries**. Area also had strategic importance for the **expansion of Germany in the east towards the Soviet Union**. Hitler claimed a part of Czechoslovakia called **Sudetenland** which had substantial German population. This area formed about one fifth of the area of Czechoslovakia and had **one of the largest munition factories in the world.**
        3. Instead of meeting the threat posed by Germany, the leaders of Britain and France **met Hitler and Mussolini at Munich in Germany in Sep 1938 and agreed to Germany's terms without the consent of Czechoslovakia**. Soon after, the Sudetenland was occupied by German troops. A few months later in March 1939 entire Czechoslovakia was **occupied** by Germany.
    17. Non-Aggression Pact - Soviet Union had been **pleading for an alliance of western powers** with them. However, the Western policies of appeasement had convinced the Soviet Union that their main interest was to **divert the German expansion towards the Soviet Union.** Stalin proceeded to sign **Non-Aggression Pact with Germany in Aug 1939**, which guaranteed that the two countries would not attack each other.
        
        1. By signing this pact, Germany had protected itself from having to fight a two-front war in the soon-to-begin World War II. In return, as part of a **secret addendum, the Soviet Union was to be** **awarded land, including parts of Poland and the Baltic States**. The pact was broken when Nazi Germany attacked the **Soviet Union less than two years later in June 1941.**￼
13. Second World War
    
    1. In spite of the fact that Western countries had **agreed to all the aggressions of Japan, Italy and Germany from the invasion of Manchuria to the annexation of Czechoslovakia, the fascist countries’ ambitions had not been satisfied**. These countries were planning another re-division of the world and thus had to come into conflict with the established imperialist powers. Western policy of diverting the aggression of the **fascist countries towards the Soviet Union had failed** with the signing of the Soviet German Non-Aggression Pact.
    2. **Danzig**, which separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany, had been made a free city independent of German control. Hitler had demanded the **return of Danzig to Germany** but Britain had refused to accept this demand. **On 1 September 1939 German armies marched into Poland. On 3 September Britain and France declared war on Germany**. Thus the **invasion of Poland** marked the beginning of the Second World War #important
    3. German armies completed the **conquest of Poland in less than three weeks** as no aid reached Poland. In spite of the declaration of war, however, there was **little actual fighting for many months**. Therefore, the war during this period from September 1939 to April 1940 when Germany invaded **Norway and Denmark is known as the ‘phoney war’.**
        
        1. Soviet Union attacked eastern Poland. In 1940, the **Baltic States of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania which had become independent after WW1 were also occupied by the Soviet Union**. They, along with Moldavia, became republics of USSR. In November 1939, the Soviet Union also went to **war against Finland.**
    4. Germany launched her invasion of Norway and Denmark on 9 April 1940 and within three weeks completed the conquest of these two countries. In Norway, the German invaders were helped by **Quisling, leader of Norway’s fascist party,** who set up a puppet government in Norway under German occupation. The very name ‘Quisling’ has come to **mean a traitor who collaborates with the invaders of his country**. In early May began the invasion of Belgium and Holland which was completed before the end of May.
        
        1. Soon the German armies **marched into France and by 14 June 1940, the capital city of Paris had fallen into German hands almost without a fight**. In the meantime, Italy also had joined the war on the **side of her ally, Germany.**
        2. On 22 June 1940, the French government surrendered and **signed a truce with Germany according to which about half of France was occupied by Germany**. The remaining part remained under the French government which was required to **disband the French army and provide for the maintenance of the German army in France.**
        3. French government which had surrendered to Germany ruled from Vichy. With the **defeat of France, Germany became the supreme power over the continent of Europe**. The war conducted by Germany with **great speed and force is known as blitzkrieg** 
    5. Britain - Britain was the only major power left in Europe after the fall of France. Germany thought that Britain **would surrender soon as she was without any allies in Europe.**
        
        1. German air force began **bombing raids on Britain in August 1940** with the aim of terrorizing her into surrender. The battle that ensued is known as the **Battle of Britain.**
        2. Royal Air Force of Britain played a **heroic role in its defense against air raids** and conducted air raids on German territories in retaliation.
        3. Under leadership of Churchill, Britain **successfully resisted the German air raids** with courage and determination.
    6. **Operation Barbarossa** - Having conquered almost the entire Europe, except Britain, Germany attacked the **Soviet Union, despite the Non-Aggression Pact,** on 22 June 1941. Hitler had always coveted the vast territory and resources of the Soviet Union.
        
        1. He thought that the destruction of the Soviet Union would take about eight weeks. Hitler had **grossly underestimated the strength of the Soviet Union**. In the first phase of the war with the Soviet Union, Germany achieved significant victories.
        2. Vast areas of the Soviet Union were devastated, Leningrad was besieged and **German troops were marching towards Moscow**. However, in spite of the initial German successes, the German **onslaught was halted**. Soviet Union had built up industrial and military strength and resisted the German invasion **heroically** and the German hopes of a quick victory were thwarted.
        3. Soon after the invasion, **Churchill and Roosevelt declared British and American’ support, respectively, to the Soviet Union in the war against** Germany and promised aid to her.
    7. Pearl Harbour - In September 1940, these three countries had signed another pact which bound them together even more. Japan recognized the leadership of Germany and Italy in the establishment of a new order in Europe and Japan’s leadership was recognized for establishing a new order in Asia.
        
        1. On 7 December 1941, the Japanese, without a declaration of war, **conducted a massive raid on the American naval base at Pearl Harbor** in Hawaii.
        2. American Pacific Fleet which was stationed there was devastated. The Americans **lost 20 warships, and about 250 aircrafts. About 3000 persons were killed.**
        3. Attack on Pearl Harbor in the midst of negotiations with Americans showed that the **Japanese were determined to conquer Asia and the Pacific.** With this the Second World War became truly global. USA declared war on Japan on 8 December 1941 and soon after **Germany and Italy declared war on the United States.**
        4. Following the U.S. entry into the war, many countries in the Americas **joined the war against Germany, Italy and Japan.** Japanese achieved significant victories in the war in Asia.
    8. Battle of Stalingrad - In January 1942 the unity of the countries **fighting against the fascist powers was cemented.**
        
        1. Representatives of 26 nations, including Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union, signed a declaration, known as the **United Nations Declaration.** Signatories to this Declaration resolved to **utilize all their resources to pursue the war until victory was achieved** and to cooperate with one another against the common enemy, and **promised not to have a separate peace treaty.** 
        2. In Nov-Dec 1941, German advance on Moscow met with **stubborn resistance and the invasion was repulsed.** Germany then launched an offensive in southern Russia. In August 1942, the German troops reached the outskirts of Stalingrad. For over five months, the battle raged. **It involved about 2 million men, 2000 tanks and 2000 airplanes**. Civilian population of Stalingrad joined the soldiers in the defense of the city. In February 1943, about **90,000 German officers and soldiers surrendered.**
    9. German Afrika Korps -was the **expeditionary force that was sent to North-Africa** during World War II.
        
        1. It was first created as a **holding force to buck up the Italian defense** of their African colonies. Afrika Korps fought in Africa, under various titles and commanders, from March 1941 until its **surrender in May 1943**
        2. Fascist alliance of Germany and Italy was **ultimately driven from the land**. After the campaign, the Allies would **turn their attention to Italy,** where they would win another crucial victory in the fight **against militant fascism in Europe**
    10. Italy - Many sections in Italy had turned against Mussolini. He was **arrested and a new government was formed**. This government joined the war against Germany. However, German troops **invaded northern Italy and Mussolini, who had escaped with the help of Germans, headed a pro-German government there**. Meanwhile, British and American troops entered Italy and a long battle to throw the Germans out of Italy followed.
    11. Second Front - Soviet Union was attaining significant victories against Germany and had already **entered Czechoslovakia and Romania** which had been under German occupation.
        
        1. On 6 June 1944, more than 100,000 British and American troops **landed on the coast of Normandy in France (D Day / Operation Neptune)**. By September their number had reached 2,000,000. The opening of this front played a **very crucial role in the defeat of Germany**. This is known as the opening of the **‘Second Front’.**
        2. Since 1942 in Europe the **most ferocious battles had been fought between Germany and the Soviet Union**. Soviet Union had been demanding the opening of the second front for long, as this would **compel Germany to fight on other fronts** also and would thus hasten the defeat of Germany.
    12. End of War - **After 6 June 1944, German armies had to face the forces of the Allies from three directions.**
        
        1. In **Italy**, the British and American troops were advancing.
        2. Northern and western France and the city of **Paris had been freed** and the Allied troops were moving towards Belgium and Holland
        3. On the eastern front, the **Germans were facing a collapse.** The Soviet army from the east and other Allied troops from the west were closing on Germany.
        4. In **May 1945 the Soviet armies entered Berlin**. Hitler had **committed suicide** on the morning of the same day. On 7 May 1945 Germany **unconditionally surrendered.** The end of all hostilities in Europe became effective from midnight of 9 May 1945
    13. Nuclear bomb - After the defeat of Germany, the war in Asia **continued for another three months**. Britain and USA had launched successful operations **against Japan in the Pacific and in the Philippines and Burma.**
        
        1. In spite of serious reverses, however, the Japanese were **still holding large parts of China.**
        2. On 6 August 1945, an **atom bomb**, the deadliest weapon developed during the war, was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. This was the first time that the atom bomb had been used. With one single bomb, the **city of Hiroshima was obliterated**. Another atom bomb was dropped on the city of Nagasaki on 9 August 1945. The city was destroyed.
        3. In the meantime, the Soviet Union had **declared war on Japan and had started military operations** against Japanese forces in Manchuria and Korea.
        4. On 14 August Japan **conveyed its acceptance of the Allied demand** to surrender but the actual surrender took place on 2 September 1945. With the Japanese surrender, the WW2 came to an end.
    14. Destruction caused by the war in terms of human lives has no precedent in history. **Over 50 million** people perished in the Second World War.
        
        1. Of them about **22 million were soldiers and over 28 million civilians**. About **12 million people lost their lives in concentration camps** or as a result of the terror unleashed by the fascists
        2. Some countries lost a **large percentage of their population**. For example, Poland lost six million people, about five million of them civilians, which was about **20% of the Polish population**. The Soviet Union in absolute terms suffered the worst — about **20 million** people which was about 10% of the population.
        3. Germany lost over six million people, about 10% of her population. Besides the human losses, the economy and material resources of many countries were badly damaged. Many **ancient cities were almost completely destroyed.**
    15. Atomic bomb - Many new weapons of destruction were devised and used in the WW2. The most dreadful of these was the atom bomb.
        
        1. Atom bomb was first devised in the USA. Scientists of many countries, including those who had **come to USA to escape the fascist tyranny in Europe**, had helped in developing it.
        2. **Project Manhattan** - to develop the bomb was taken up when a number of scientists including Einstein and Oppenheimer, suspecting that the **Nazi Germany was developing the atom bomb, approached the US government.**
        3. They had feared that if the Nazis developed the bomb, they would use it to **terrorize the world into submission**. Atom bomb was first tested in July 1945. By then, Germany had already surrendered.
        4. Many of those who had helped in its development appealed to the US government not to use it against Japan against whom the war was still continuing. They also **warned of the danger of starting a race in the production of atomic weapons if the atom bomb was used against Japan.**
        5. However, the President Truman used the atom bombs against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima (Little Boy) and Nagasaki (Fat Man). These two bombs **killed over 320,000 people almost instantaneously and completely wiped out large parts of the two cities**. The effects of these bombs on the health of those who survived and on their children continue to this day.
        6. USA justified the use of the atom bomb on the ground that it **brought WW2 immediately to a close and thus helped to save human lives** which would have been lost if the war had continued. Many other people, including the scientists who had helped in making the bomb **condemned its use.**
    16. Holocaust - Holocaust was the **systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of 6 million Jews** by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. Holocaust is a word of Greek origin meaning **"sacrifice by fire."**
        
        1. The Nazis, who came to power in Germany in January 1933, believed that **Germans were "racially superior" and that the Jews, deemed "inferior,"** were an alien threat to the so-called German racial community.
        2. Although Jews, whom the Nazis deemed a priority danger to Germany, **were the primary victims of Nazi racism, other victims included some 200,000 Roma (Gypsies)**. At least **200,000 mentally or physically disabled patients**, mainly Germans, living in institutional settings, were murdered in the so-called **Euthanasia Program.**
        3. To concentrate and monitor the Jewish population as well as to facilitate later deportation of the Jews, the Germans and their collaborators **created ghettos, transit camps, and forced-labor camps for Jews during the war years**. The German authorities also established numerous forced-labor camps, both in the so-called Greater German Reich and in German-occupied territory, for **non-Jews whose labor the Germans sought to exploit.**
        4. Steps to Death - **Stage 1 Exclusion**. Nuremberg **Laws of citizenship of Sep 1935** (marriages bw Jews and Germans were forbidden, boycott of Jewish business). **Stage 2 Ghettoisation, All Jews to wear yellow Star of David** and surrender all their wealth and sent to a ghetto. **Stage 3 Annihilation.** The Final Solution - **mass killings within minutes with scientific precision.** ￼
14. Post War Years
    
    1. World has been completely transformed during the years since end of WW2. Its **political map has also changed**. Influence and the dominations which a few European imperialist powers exercised in the prewar years became things of the past. **Large number of nations in Asia and Africa emerged as independent nations.** Soviet Union also **emerged as a mighty power**, in spite of the terrible devastation it suffered during the war 
        
        1. Danger of a new world war which would destroy human life altogether created a new awareness of the **need for establishing lasting peace**. Peoples and nations made efforts in this direction by **promoting mutual relations based on friendship and cooperation**. They also created many new institutions and agencies for the purpose.
        2. However, in spite of these efforts the period after WW2 has been full of conflicts and wars in which hundreds of thousands of people have been killed even though the **world has escaped a large-scale conflagration.**
    2. WW2: Immediate consequences
        
        1. During the war, the major Allied nations had **held many conferences and had issued declarations stating the principles** which would form the basis of peace. The first major declaration had been issued by Britain and USA in 1941 which stated that they **would not seek any territory**. It also supported the right of every people to have the **form of government of their choice**. Early in 1942 was issued the **United Nations Declaration**. This Declaration supported the one issued by Britain and USA earlier. Another declaration stated that **all the Chinese territories taken by Japan would be restored** to her. In 1943, Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin, leaders of Britain, USA and the Soviet Union, respectively, **met at Tehran.**
        2. **Yalta Conference** - Early in 1945 when Germany was on the verge of defeat, the heads of the three big nations **met at Yalta in the Soviet Union.**
            
            1. Germany to be split into **4 zones and Germany to pay reparations**. Govt of national unity to be set up in Poland **comprising of both communists and non-communists**
            2. **Free elections in countries of eastern Europe** - Declaration of Liberated Europe
            3. Russia to help **against Japan upon Germany's defeat**
        3. United Nations - Subsequently, a **conference was held at San Francisco**, USA, from 25 April 1945. The conference was attended by **50 nations**. On 26 June the conference adopted the United Nations Charter under which a **new world organization was set up**. This was the United Nations Organization which was based on the **principle of “the sovereign equality of all peace loving states”** 
        4. **Potsdam Conference** - Bw Britain, USA and the Soviet Union was held at **Potsdam (near Berlin) from 17 July to 2 August 1945.**
            
            1. Declaration issued by this conference mentioned the main aims of the Allies with regard to Germany which had already surrendered. Germany had been **partitioned into four zones**, each under the control of Britain, France, the United States and the Soviet Union.
            2. Objective to bring about the **complete disarmament of Germany**, to destroy the Nazi Party and to prepare conditions for the **creation of a democratic Germany.**
            3. It was also decided to set up an **international tribunal to bring to trial persons** who had committed crimes against humanity.
            4. Decisions were also taken regarding the border between Poland and Germany, and the transfer of the **northern part of East Prussia to the Soviet Union and the southern part to Poland.**
            5. America had tested **atomic bomb by then and informed Atlee and Stalin** of the same
    3. Rise of communism in Europe - **Communist parties and other antifascist parties** in these countries had played an **important role in the struggle against German occupation** of these countries.
        
        1. By the end of 1948, the governments of all these countries were **dominated by the Communist parties.** In Albania and Yugoslavia, the struggle against German occupation had, been led by the **Communist parties of these countries**.
        2. In these countries too Communist parties formed the governments. **Up to WW2, Soviet Union was the only country ruled by Communists.** Now a large number of European countries were ruled by Communist parties. Other political parties were **either not allowed to exist or had only a nominal presence.**
        3. Within the Communist parties themselves, differences over policies were **not allowed and the power within, the Communist parties became concentrated in a few hands**. As in the Soviet Union, dissent even within the ruling parties was not tolerated and many veteran communists were shot or sentenced to long periods of imprisonment
    4. Germany -  The four powers —Britain, France, USA and the Soviet Union which were in occupation of four different zones of Germany followed different policies in dealing with the social, economic and political problems in their respective zones.
        
        1. In the British, French and American zones, the **economic development continued on capitalist lines.** The two major parties in these zone, were the **Christian Democratic Party** and the **Social Democratic Party.** In 1948, Britain, France and the United States decided to merge the three zones under their control which were in **West Germany and form a separate state of West Germany** called the Federal Republic of Germany with its capital at Bonn
        2. In East Germany which was **under Soviet occupation, the policies pursued were different** from those that had been followed in the western zones. **Lands were distributed among peasants and all the major industries were taken over from private hands** and made the property of the state. In 1946 the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party in the Soviet zone of Germany merged to form the **Socialist Unity Party of Germany**. In October 1949, the Soviet zone became a separate state called the **German Democratic Republic.** 
        3. Division of Germany had been a **source of tension in Europe** and a major factor in the Cold War. East Berlin was the capital of East Germany while **West Berlin which was located within the GDR territory was treated as a part of West Germany.** In 1961, the GDR authorities built a **wall between East and West Berlin** to prevent East Germans from going away to West Berlin.
        4. Building of the wall became a **further source of tension in Europe**. Process of ending communist rule in GDR and of the **reunification of Germany began in 1989** when the Berlin Wall was pulled down and political parties which were outside the control of Socialist Unity Party were allowed to function. **In early 1990 elections were held and a new government came to power**. On 3 October 1990, the division of Germany was ended and a unified Germany again emerged.
    5. Britain - In Britain, the elections were held in July 1945. Conservative Party whose leader was **Winston Churchill during the war lost and the Labour Party came to power.**
        
        1. Many important industries such as coal mines and railways **were nationalized.** Steps were taken to **provide social security to the people**, and to build a **welfare state in Britain.**
        2. However, period after the Second World War saw the **rapid decline of their empires as process of decolonization had begun.**
    6. Eastern Europe - In 1956, three years after the death of Stalin, the Communist Party of Soviet Union had **denounced the excesses and crimes committed by Stalin.**
        
        1. From 1985, many important reforms began to be introduced in the political system of the Soviet Union with a view to **promoting political democracy.** There was free and open discussion on every issue and curbs on the freedom of thought and expression were lifted. **Perestroika (restructuring)** and **glasnost (openness)** were the key pillars of reforms sought to be introduced by **Mikhail Gorbachev**
        2. In the meantime, there was a demand for **greater autonomy by the republics** which constituted the Soviet Union. Some republics wanted to become independent. Attempts were made to frame a new treaty which would **provide greater autonomy to the republics** and at the same time preserve the Union
        3. However, in August 1991, there was an attempt to stage a **coup by some leaders of the Communist Party.** Though the coup collapsed, the Soviet Union began to break up. **Many republics declared their independence.** On 25 December 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev, who was the President of the Soviet Union during this period and had initiated the reforms mentioned earlier, **resigned and the Soviet Union formally ceased to exist**.
        4. Though the rule of the communist parties has ended in all these republics, many of them are faced with **serious political and economic problems**. 12 of them have formed a loose federation called **Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)**
        5. **Warsaw Pact 1955,** the military alliance which was headed by the Soviet Union and of which the communist ruled states of Europe were members, was dissolved in 1991. Was established as a **counterweight to NATO, but no direct confrontation** between them. Instead, the conflict was fought on an **ideological basis and in proxy wars.** Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact led to the **expansion of military forces and their integration into the respective blocs.**
        6. Collapse of the Soviet Union has also been seen as **marking the retreat of socialism.** It can, however, be said that the system which was built in these countries was **only a distorted version of the socialist ideal** and that social justice which was fundamental to that ideal has become a **part of the consciousness of the people the world over.**
    7. Break up of Yugoslavia -
        
        1. After the Allied victory in World War II, Yugoslavia was set up as a **federation of six republics, with borders drawn along ethnic and historical lines**: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia. In addition, two autonomous provinces were established within Serbia: **Vojvodina and Kosovo**.
        2. Each of the republics had its **own branch of the League of Communists** of Yugoslavia party and a ruling elite, and any tensions were solved on the federal level.
        3. Yugoslav model of **state organization, as well as a "middle way" between planned and liberal economy**, had been a relative success, and the country experienced a period of strong economic growth and relative political stability up to the 1980s, **under the rule of president-for-life Josip Broz Tito.** After his death in 1980, the weakened system of federal government was **left unable to cope with rising economic and political challenges.**
        4. Breakup of Yugoslavia occurred as a result of a **series of political upheavals and conflicts during the early 1990s.** After a period of political crisis in the 1980s, **constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia split apart**, but the unsolved issues caused bitter inter-ethnic Yugoslav wars. The wars primarily affected Bosnia and Herzegovina and neighboring parts of Croatia.
    8. Cold War -  antagonism between the United States and the Soviet Union and the armed confrontation between the military blocs headed by them
        
        1. Since the end WW1, USA had emerged as the **strongest power in the world.** After WW2, her power had grown still more compared with the European powers who had dominated the world for centuries. This was both in the **spheres of economic and military strength**. After it acquired the atom bomb, the awareness of her power was further strengthened.
        2. Soviet Union had suffered more than any other country in the war. Besides the 20 million people it lost during the war, hundreds of her towns and thousands of factories had been completely destroyed.
            
            1. However, in spite of these losses, **Soviet power and prestige had increased.** This was to some extent due to the very important **role it had played in defeating Germany.**
            2. Since the revolution, she had been **ostracized and boycotted** and had faced the open hostility of the other big powers. However, after the war, a number of countries in Europe, as has already been mentioned, **were ruled by communist parties**. The Soviet Union exercised a lot of influence over the governments of these countries. As a result of these developments, the **isolation of the Soviet Union had come to an end.** 
        3. During the war, Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union had together fought against the fascist countries.
            
            1. Many declarations issued during the war had emphasized that the **unity among these countries would continue after the war** also and would be the basis of a durable peace and international brotherhood. These declarations had aroused hopes all over the world.
            2. However, the war was hardly over when conflicts and tensions began to emerge between Britain and the United States on the one hand and the Soviet Union on the other.
            3. The relations between them began to deteriorate and **came to be characterized by what has been called the Cold War**. Gradually, the Cold War became more and more intense and the world was divided into two major blocs — USA and West European countries forming one bloc and the Soviet Union and the socialist countries of Eastern Europe forming the other.
        4. Most important reason for the ‘outbreak’ of the Cold War was the **Western countries’ fear of communism.**
            
            1. With the increase in the **might of the Soviet Union**, the emergence of governments ruled by communist parties in Eastern and Central Europe and the **growing strength of communist** parties in many parts of the world, **alarmed** the governments of the United States, Britain and other West European countries.
            2. In **1949, the victory of the Communist Party of China in the civil war** which had been raging there for about two decades added to the alarm.
            3. United States openly declared that her policy **was to prevent the spread of communism**. One of the objectives of the massive economic aid that the United States gave to West European countries was also to **‘contain’ communism.** USA began to look upon every development in the world from this standpoint, whether it **promoted or helped in checking communism.** Britain and West European countries became aligned with the United States and began to follow a policy mainly aimed at curbing the growth of communism.
            4. This had many **adverse consequences for democracy**, and freedom movements in the colonies. Freedom movements in many countries began to be **considered unsympathetically by countries** which were not themselves colonial powers but were aligned to the colonial powers.
    9. The growing tension in the world was worsened by the **setting up of military blocs.**
        
        1. NATO - In 1949, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was formed for **defense against the Soviet Union**. The members of this alliance were the United States, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Portugal, Britain, France, Belgium, Holland and Luxemburg. Turkey, Greece, the Federal Republic of Germany and Spain became its members later. A NATO army was created which **established its bases in many countries of Europe**. Similar military alliances were set up by the United States and Britain in other parts of the world.
        2. SEATO - In 1954 **South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO)** was setup with the United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, the Philippines and Pakistan as members.
        3. **Baghdad Pact** - In 1955 the Baghdad Pact was brought into being. It consisted of **Britain, Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan and Iran.** USA established its military bases all over the world for use against what she **considered the danger of communist aggression**. The formation of these alliances and the establishment of military bases **worsened the already tense international situation.** In some countries which were members of these alliances, these alliances were **very unpopular.** For example, when there was a revolution in **Iraq in 1958, that country withdrew** from the Baghdad Pact which had been named after capital of Iraq.
            
            1. CENTO - name of Baghdad Pact was then changed to the **Central Treaty Organization** (CENTO). These alliances were **generally unpopular** in the countries of Asia and Africa as all the imperialist powers of Europe were members of these alliances and used it to **suppress the movements for freedom.** Most of the countries of Asia and Africa which had won their freedom refused to join these alliances.
        4. **Warsaw Pact 1955 to 1991** - Soviet Union and the **socialist countries of Europe** —Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and the German Democratic Republic formed the Warsaw Pact.
            
            1. Under this pact, the Soviet Union **stationed her troops in these countries.** However, the Soviet Union and the other members of the Warsaw Pact **did not have any military bases in other parts** of the world. Soviet Union had treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with China.
    10. **Arms Race** - formation of the military alliances was accompanied by another dangerous development. This was the **race for deadlier weapons of destruction**
        
        1. In 1949, the Soviet Union tested its **first atom bomb**. A few years later nuclear weapons which were thousands of times more destructive than the atom bombs used against Japan, were developed. These were the **thermonuclear or hydrogen bombs.**
        2. The testing alone of these bombs **created serious hazards to life**. Many movements were launched in all parts of the world to **demand a ban on the testing and manufacture of nuclear weapons.** 
        3. However, the arsenals of nuclear weapons in the world went on increasing. Along with the nuclear weapons and many other kinds of weaponry, **new bombers, submarines and missiles** have been developed which can carry these weapons over thousands of kilometers.
    11. Major Cold War Events
        
        1. ![1962 CRISIS The Soviets deploy nuclear missiles in Cuba. in striking range of Florida. President John F. Kennedy responds with a naval blockade of Cuba and the two sides are at the brink of nuclear war. After a 13-day standoff. the Soviets remove the missiles. 1979 ArGHAN INVASION Soviet troops invade Afghanistan in support of the Marxist government, which 196091975 VIETNAM WAR In 1965. the U.S. sends combat troops to aid South Vietnam in its war against Communist North Vietnam. which is supported by the Soviets and the Chinese. By the time U.S. troops leave in 1973.58,000 Americans have died. The war ends in 1975 when Communist forces overrun the south.

        2. In the 1970s and early 1980s, some beginnings were made to end the Cold War. Agreements were reached between the United States and the Soviet Union to **eliminate some categories of carriers** of nuclear weapons and to reduce the number of certain types of weapons installed in certain areas. The process of ending the Cold War, however, suffered many setbacks, for example:
            
            1. **Afghanistan** - In 1979, Soviet troops entered Afghanistan. This development increased the tension between the United States and the Soviet Union.
            2. **Star Wars** - United States launched a program of developing **new and even more deadly weapons STRATEGIC DEFENSE INITIATIVE**, popularly known as the Star Wars. These weapons would have meant taking the **conflict into outer space and launching attacks** from there.
        3. Throughout the 1980s, the Soviet Union fought an **increasingly frustrating war** in **Afghanistan**. At the same time, the Soviet economy faced the **continuously escalating costs of the arms race**. Dissent at home grew while the stagnant economy faltered under the combined burden. Attempted reforms at home left the Soviet Union **unwilling to rebuff challenges** to its control in Eastern Europe.
            
            1. During 1989 and 1990, the Berlin Wall came down, borders opened, and **free elections ousted Communist regimes** everywhere in eastern Europe.
            2. In late 1991 the Soviet Union itself **dissolved into its component republics**. With stunning speed, the **Iron Curtain was lifted** and the Cold War came to an end.
    12. Non-Alignment - Many newly independent nations of Asia and Africa as well as many nations in other continents **did not like the military blocs.** They began to follow a **policy of nonalignment with any military bloc**. Their emergence played a very important role in reducing the **intensity of the Cold War** and in creating an atmosphere of peace. A crucial role in promoting nonalignment and peace was **played by India** after her independence.
        
        1. Emergence of the countries of Asia and Africa as independent nations marked a new phase in the history of the world. These countries which had been **suppressed and kept under subjugation** for a long time came to their own and began to play an important role in the world.
        2. Similar developments have also taken place in Central and South America and the Caribbean. The countries which were under European colonial rule in this part of the world had become independent.
        3. **United States frequently interfered** in the internal affairs of these countries, particularly when radical governments came to power and tried to assert their political and economic independence.
        4. In 1955, an important event took place which helped to strengthen the unity of African and Asian countries. This was the **Afro Asian conference** which was held at **Bandung** in Indonesia. The conference was attended by 23 Asian and 6 African countries. The leaders of three Asian nations, India, China and Indonesia played an important role in the deliberations of this conference.
            
            1. Conference adopted a **"declaration on promotion of world peace and cooperation"**, which included Nehru's five principles, and a collective pledge to remain neutral in the Cold War.
            2. Growing importance of the Afro Asian countries was reflected in the United Nations where on a number of issues the countries of **Asia and Africa functioned as a group**.
    13. Most of the newly independent countries of Asia and Africa **refused to join the Cold War**. They considered the formation of military blocs as a **serious danger to peace** and to their independence.
        
        1. These countries were faced with the **enormous task of social and economic reconstruction** which could be done only in a world free from war and tension.
        2. Some countries in Asia had joined the **military alliances and had allowed foreign bases to be set up** on their soil. The extension of military alliances and the setting up of foreign bases were considered by most Asian countries as a threat to their Independence and a source of tension. Hence **they opposed these alliances**.
        3. Non-Aligned nations of Asia and Africa, therefore, were in the forefront of the struggle for the **liquidation of colonialism**. Nonalignment has primarily been a policy aiming at the strengthening of independence, **ending of colonialism and promoting world peace**. It was not merely a policy of noninvolvement with military blocs but a policy for creating a better world.
        4. First summit conference of Non-Aligned nations was held at **Belgrade in Yugoslavia in September 1961 under Josip Broz Tito.** It was attended by heads of state or government of 25 countries. Besides Yugoslavia and Cuba, other participating countries were from Asia and Africa. Three other countries attended as observers.
        5. Beginning with 25 Countries which attended the Belgrade conference in 1961, there are today **109 countries which are following the policy of nonalignment**. Two movements of national liberation —the Palestine Liberation Organization and South West Africa People’s Organization —were made **full fledged member states** of the Non-Aligned Movement. India hosted 7th summit in Delhi **under Indira Gandhi in 1983****￼**
15. **Asian decolonization** - countries in Africa and Asia had long and sometimes bitter struggle against colonial rule. Generally, colonial powers were not willing to give up their hold on the colonies and left only when they found that it was **not possible to maintain** their rule any more.
    
    1. Imperialism as a whole had been **weakened as a result of the war**. The economies of many imperialist countries had suffered. Forces (communist and socialist parties) within the imperialist countries which were **friendly with the peoples struggling** for independence also had grown powerful.
        
        1. Freedom and democracy were the **major aims for which the Allies had fought against the fascist countries** and these aims had been made the basis for arousing peoples all over the world against fascism. The fulfilment of these aims could no longer be confined only to Europe
        2. In many colonies which **fascist countries had occupied by ousting the older colonial powers**, the freedom movements had played an important role in the **struggle against fascist occupation**. E.g. Japanese occupation in SE Asia.
        3. Another major international factor which facilitated the end of imperialism was the **emergence of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries as a major force**. These countries were inimical to **imperialism and often gave aid and support** to the freedom movements in the colonies. 
        4. Freedom movement in one country **supported the freedom movements in other countries.** Role of countries which had achieved their independence was very crucial in this regard. These countries supported the cause of those peoples who were still under colonial rule at the United Nations and other international forums.
        5. Besides the movements in the colonies for independence, there were also **movements in Asian and African countries to oust outdated political systems, to modernize the social and economic systems** and to assume control over the resources of one’s country which had remained under foreign control even after freedom
    2. Burma - achieved her independence from **Britain a few months** after India became independent.
        
        1. In 1944, the **Antifascist People’s Freedom League** (AFPFL) had been formed in Burma. Its aim was to **resist the Japanese invasion** of Burma and to win independence for Burma.
        2. After the war, the British tried to restore their rule over Burma. This led to the **intensification of the movement** for freedom. In the course of the struggle, many leaders of the Burmese freedom **movement were assassinated.**
        3. However, Britain was forced to agree to the **demand for freedom and Burma became independent on 4 January 1948.**
    3. Indonesia - After the defeat of Japan, **Sukarno, one of the pioneers of the freedom movement** in Indonesia, proclaimed the independence of Indonesia.
        
        1. However, soon after the British troops landed there in order to **help the Dutch** **to restore their rule.** The government of independent Indonesia which had been formed by Sukarno resisted the attempt to reestablish colonial rule.
        2. There were demands in many countries of the world to **put an end to the war which had been started in Indonesia** to restore the Dutch rule. In Asian countries, the reaction was particularly intense. The leaders of the Indian freedom movement demanded that Indian soldiers, who had been sent to Indonesia as a **part of the British army should be withdrawn.**
        3. After India became free, she convened a **conference of Asian nations in support of Indonesia’s independence.** The conference met in New Delhi in January 1949 and called for the **complete independence of Indonesia.**
        4. Resistance of the Indonesian people and the **mounting pressure of world opinion** and Asian countries compelled Holland to set the leaders of Indonesian people free. On 2 November 1949, **Holland recognized the independence** of Indonesia.
    4. Sri Lanka
        
        1. mainly as a consequence of the **militant freedom struggle in India** that the less militant Sri Lanka won its independence. It was initiated around the turn of the 20th century and led **mostly by the educated middle class.**
        2. **But remained Dominion until 1972.**
    5. Thailand
        
        1. Thailand was the only country in South East Asia which was not colonized by Europeans. All of its neighbors were controlled by either the British or the French. Burma and Malaysia being British colonies and Laos and Cambodia being French.
        2. Served  as **buffer between French Indochina and British empire** and partly due to **reforms and modernization** carried by Rama IV and Rama V
        3. Under the monarchy, Thai foreign policy **welcomed both the British in Burma and the French in Vietnam**, which neutralized two long-standing threats to Thai security and hegemony.
        4. Siam signed Burney Treaty agreeing to **establish a uniform taxation system, to reduce taxes on foreign trade and to abolish some of the royal monopolies.** It increased in trade, thus kingdom became wealthier and army better equipped.
    6. Philippines
        
        1. Unilaterally declared independence from Spain in 1898 under leadership of **Emilio Aguinaldo**, culminating the **1896 Revolution.** Unbeknownst to newly established government and the Filipino people in general, **USA had secretly arranged to purchase the colony** along with several other possessions from Spain through the Treaty of Paris
        2. By the 1920s, the **peaceful efforts by the Filipino leadership to pursue independence proved convincing**. When the Democrats returned to power in 1933, they worked with Filipino to plan a smooth transition to independence. It was scheduled for 1946
    7. Malaysia
    8. China - After the **Japanese invasion of China,** the two parties and their armies cooperated for some time to resist the Japanese aggression.
        
        1. However, the conflicts between the two never ceased. The **Kuomintang** under **Chiang Kai-Shek** was a party which mainly represented the **interests of capitalists and landlords.**
        2. **Communist Party,** on the other hand, was a party of workers and peasants. In the areas under Communist Party’s control, the estates of landlords had been expropriated and the land distributed among the peasants. Because of the policies pursued by the Communist Party, it gradually had **won over millions of Chinese people to its side**. Communist Party had also organized a **huge army called the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).**
        3. After the defeat of Japan and the driving out of the Japanese forces from China, the civil war again broke out. The government of the **United Stated gave massive aid to Chiang Kai-shek**, but by 1949 his armies were completely routed. With the remnants of his troops, **Chiang Kai-shek went to Taiwan (Formosa)**, an island which had been occupied by Japan after she had defeated China in 1895.
        4. On 1st October 1949, the People’s Republic of China was proclaimed and the Communist Party of China under the **leadership of** **Mao Zedong** came to power.
        5. Establishment of the People’s Republic of China was a **defeat for USA**. Refused to recognize the government of China for over two decades till 1971.
    9. Korea -  After **Japan’s defeat in the Second World War**, Korea was divided into two zones, the northern zone under Soviet occupation and the southern zone under American occupation, to **bring about the surrender of Japanese troops.**
        
        1. Aim was to make Korea an independent state. However, as in the case of Germany in Europe, **two different governments in Korea** were formed in 1948.
        
        |
        |
        ==North== ==Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) under the leadership of Korean Communists (Kim Il-sung)==
        ==South== ==Republic of Korea (South Korea) by a group of parties under the leadership of Syngman Rhee.==
        
        3. Rhee was an **anticommunist** and wanted an alliance with **Chiang Kai-shek t**o prevent the spread of communism. Both the states organized their armies and there were frequent clashes between them. In 1948, the Soviet troops **withdrew from Korea followed by the American troops who withdrew in 1949**. Both the governments of Korea favored unification of the country but there was no meeting ground between them.
        4. In June 1950 war broke out between North and South Korea. The Chinese revolution had already taken place and **USA feared further expansion** of communism in this area. USA sent troops to **support South Korea** in the war.
        5. These troops fought as the troops of the United Nations because UNSC had passed a resolution **condemning North Korea** and had asked members of the UN to aid South Korea. The armistice was signed in **1953 Korea remained divided** into two separate states
        6. Differences emerged between North Korea and the Soviet Union, central among them **Kim Il-sung's philosophy of** **Juche**, which focused on Korean nationalism and self-reliance. Despite this, the country received funds, subsidies and aid from the USSR (and the Eastern Bloc) until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
    10. Vietnam - After the **French government surrendered to Germany**, many parts of Indo-China were occupied by Japan.
        
        1. Movement for the freedom of **Indo-China from French rule had started** many years earlier. Greatest leader of the people of Vietnam was **Ho Chi Minh.** He had been engaged in organizing the communist and the nationalist movements in Vietnam since soon after the end of WW1.
        2. Vietnamese people under Ho Chi Minh’s leadership **resisted the Japanese occupation** and organized a people’s army called the **Viet Minh**. By the time the Second World War ended, the **Viet Minh controlled a large part of Vietnam**. In August 1945, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed with Ho Chi Minh as President. However, the British troops as well as the troops of Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Vietnam in the pretext of **completing the surrender of Japanese troops** there.
        3. In October 1945, the French troops also arrived with the **aim of restoring French rule**. In 1946, the French army started fighting against the Viet Minh. They also set up a government with **Bao Dal, who had headed the puppet government** under Japan earlier, as the ruler. The war between the Viet Minh and France continued for eight years.
        4. In 1954, the French forces **suffered a severe blow at the hands of Viet Minh** at the fortress of Dien-Bien-Phu. The French defeat at **Dien-Bien-Phu** has become famous because a **people’s army without any sophisticated** defeated the army of a powerful imperialist country. The debacle at Dien-Bien-Phu compelled the French government to start negotiations with the government of Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
        5. In July 1954 an international conference was held at Geneva. It was **agreed to partition Vietnam temporarily into North and South Vietnam** and to hold elections all over Vietnam within two years to unify the country under a single government.
    11. Vietnam War (1955-1975) - With the partition of Vietnam, **another phase in the freedom movement in Vietnam began.**
        
        1. The government that was established in South Vietnam, with USA support, **refused to abide by the decisions of the Geneva conference** with regard to the holding of elections and the unification of Vietnam.
        2. It came to be increasingly regarded as being under the control of the United States which was **opposed to the unification of Vietnam under the leadership of the communist party.** In the early 1960s, **uprisings broke out in South Vietnam** against the government there. This was a Cold War era proxy war.
        3. This was followed by the **massive American military intervention** in Vietnam. Hundreds of thousands of American troops were sent there with some of the **most advanced weaponry to suppress** the popular uprising. The war continued for a number of years.
        4. South Vietnamese people led by the **National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) carried on guerilla warfare**. They had the support of **North Vietnam** (conventional warfare). The American troops **carried the war into North Vietnam**. Incalculable damage was done to Vietnam as a result of the heavy bombings by American forces.
        5. **Gulf of Tonkin** **incident 1964** - involved either one or two separate confrontations involving **North Vietnam and the United States** in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. The original American report blamed North Vietnam for both incidents, but it eventually became evident that their claim about the **incident was false, and deliberately so**. Led to passage of Gulf of Tonkin Resolution which gave US President Authority to assist any SE Asian govt facing communist aggression.
        6. **Tet Offensive** was one of the largest military campaigns of the war in **1968 by North Vietnam against South Vietnam**. Campaign of surprise attacks against military and civilian command and control centers throughout South Vietnam. **Tet Offensive failed in its goal of overthrowing the South Vietnamese government,** but became the turning point in the war, as it persuaded a large segment of the U.S. population that its **government's claims of progress toward winning the war were illusory** despite many years of massive U.S. military aid to South Vietnam.
        7. Opposition to the war grew in **USA itself on an unprecedented scale.** Thousands of Americans **refused to be drafted** in the U.S. army and many American soldiers deserted. No other single issue had united millions of people all over the world as the war in Vietnam. However, America **continued the war** even though it was clear they could not win it.
        8. **Early in 1975, the war took a decisive turn.** The armies of North Vietnam and of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam **swept across the country** **routing the American supported troops** of the government of South Vietnam. In January 1973, the American troops had **begun to withdraw from Vietnam.** During the war in Vietnam, **58,000 of them had lost their lives**. By 30 April 1975, all the American troops had withdrawn and the capital of South Vietnam, **Saigon, was liberated.** North and South Vietnam were formally united as one country in 1976.
    12. Cambodia - War in Vietnam had also spread to Cambodia In 1970
        
        1. Govt of **Prince Sihanouk was overthrown** and a pro-USA military led **Khmer Republic** was established. The troops of the USA and South Vietnam had **carried the war to Cambodia** on the ground that the Vietnamese were receiving their supplies from bases in Cambodia.
        2. By the time the United States withdrew from the war in 1975, a **party which called itself Khmer Rouge** (communist party backed by **North Vietnam, Viet Cong, China)** had taken control of Cambodia under the **leadership of Pol Pot.** The government of Pol Pot established a **regime of terror in Cambodia** and started following a policy of genocide against its own people.
        3. **Khmer Rouge** regime was highly **autocratic, xenophobic, paranoid, and repressive**. The genocide was under the guise of the Khmer Rouge **enforcing its social engineering policies.** Its attempts at **agricultural reform led to widespread famine**, while its insistence on absolute self-sufficiency, even in the supply of medicine, led to the **death of thousands from treatable diseases such as malaria**. Part of the purification included numerous genocides of **Cambodian minorities.** Estimates of people murdered by the Khmer Rouge vary from one to three million **(25% of population)**
        4. In 1979, Pol Pot’s government was overthrown with the **help of Vietnamese troops.** However, the war in Cambodia continued as the **Khmer Rouge still had some areas under its control** inside the country. In the meantime, three groups, including the Khmer Rouge and the group led by **Narodom Sihanouk**, came together in opposition to the government in Cambodia which was supported by Vietnam.￼
16. **West Asia and Africa**
    
    1. Syria & Lebanon - After the war, the French tried to **restore their authority over Syria and Lebanon** but, in the face of opposition from the people of these countries and the world opinion, they were **forced to withdraw.** Both Syria and Lebanon became independent by the end of 1946.
    2. **Arab League** est 1945 - There was an **upsurge in all the Arab countries** at this time and the 1950s saw their emergence as independent nations. Some countries which had been **nominally free asserted their independence.**
        
        1. There were also movements to **overthrow the outdated political systems** which existed in some countries. All these led to conflicts and, in some cases, **prolonged wars** between the Arab countries and the imperialist powers.
        2. The period saw the **growing power of Arab nationalism** which led to efforts by the Arab people and governments to come together to **face and solve common problems.** The Arab League was formed comprising all the Arab states.
    3. Israel - Palestine issue: **Palestine had become a British mandate in 1919** after WW1. The **British troops again occupied** the country in 1945.
        
        1. Palestine was inhabited by Arabs and Jews. A movement called the **Zionist movement claimed that Palestine was the homeland** of all the Jews, wherever they may be living, and should be restored to them.
        2. Persecution which the Jews in Europe had **suffered for centuries** had culminated in the Nazi Germany’s policy of exterminating them. Millions of Jews were killed in Germany and countries occupied by Germany. The **terrible tragedy had won them the sympathy and support** of the world.
        3. British in Palestine had **permitted some Jews from outside Palestine to settle** there. The Zionists had, meanwhile, been **campaigning for a Jewish state there.** This had complicated the freedom movement in Palestine the **majority of whose inhabitants were Arabs.** In 1947 the United Nations passed a resolution according to which Palestine was to be **divided into an Arab state and a Jewish state.** However, in 1948, the British withdrew their troops from Palestine and soon after the **state of Israel was proclaimed.** This led to a war between the Arab states and Israel. The Arab states were defeated in the war.
        4. **Creation of Israel became a source of tension** in West Asia. Arab states refused to recognize her as a legitimate state, Policies pursued by the government of Israel further added to the bitterness. About **900,000 Arabs were forced to leave their homes and lands in Palestine** and were rendered homeless. They found shelter in various refugee camps in Arab states.
            
            1. Since World War II, the **US has vied to achieve two main foreign policy objectives** in the Middle East: Control the region and **its resources and prop-up its allies** (often dictators), while maintaining a **degree of "stability"** so that the US is able to conduct its business unhindered.
            2. Most countries of Asia and Africa condemned the **Israeli government’s treatment of the Arabs of Palestine and for following racist policies.** In 1956, Israel joined Britain and France in **invading Egypt to reopen Straits of Tiran**
            3. In spite of the resolutions of the United Nations, Israel refuse to vacate Arab territories and restore the rights of the Palestinian Arabs, many of whom live as refugees in various Arab states. In 1964, the **Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)** was formed to fight for the establishment of a Palestinian state. It enjoys the status of a member-state of the Non-Aligned Movement.
            4. Later there were other wars (Six Day War in 1967) between **Israel and the Arab states** as a result of which Israel occupied large parts of the territories of other Arab states. These territories include the **Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and the West Bank.** Israeli morale and international prestige were greatly increased by the outcome of the war and the area under Israeli control tripled.
            5. Arab world had experienced **humiliation in the lopsided rout of the Egyptian–Syrian–Jordanian alliance** in the Six-Day War but felt psychologically vindicated by **early successes in Yom Kippur War.** The war led Israel to recognize that, despite impressive operational and tactical achievements on the battlefield, there was no guarantee that they would always dominate the Arab states militarily, as they had consistently through the **earlier First Arab–Israeli War, the Suez War, and the Six-Day War.** These changes paved the way for the subsequent peace process. The **1978 Camp David Accords** that followed led to the return of the Sinai to Egypt and **normalized relations**—the first peaceful recognition of Israel by an Arab country. (Led to Egypt being booted out of Arab League and **assassination of Anwar Sadat)**
    4. Africa -  After WW1, only change that took place there was the **transfer of former German colonies in Africa to victorious Allied powers**. However, the period after WW1 saw a resurgence of nationalist movements in Africa. After WW2, the disintegration of the colonial rule in Africa began.
        
        1. Countries of **southern Africa began to gain their independence** after the mid-1950s. Within two decades, almost every country in Africa, with the exception of South Africa and South-West Africa (Namibia), became independent.
        2. Freedom movements in Africa, as in other parts of the world, were the **consequence of the growth of nationalism** and the increasing **resentment against the exploitation** and oppression by the colonial countries. WW2 had resulted in the general **weakening of imperialism**.
