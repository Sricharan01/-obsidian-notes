**Indian Paintings****￼**  
Leaving aside the wealth of materials of the Harappan Culture, the art of India, as a whole disappears from our sight for many years. This gap in Indian art cannot be filled satisfactorily as yet. Vinayapithak, a Buddhist text of circa 3rd - 4th century B.C. refers in many places to the pleasure houses containing picture halls which were adorned with painted figures and decorative patterns.**￼**

1. Early mural paintings may be assumed to be the prototypes of the carved and painted picture galleries of the subsequent periods of the Buddhist art, such as in the painted cave temples of Ajanta situated in Maharashtra State near Aurangabad.
    
    1. Subject matter of these paintings is almost exclusively Buddhist, excepting decorative patterns on the ceilings and the pillars. They are **mostly associated with the Jatakas**, collection of stories, recording the previous births of the Lord Buddha. 
    2. earliest paintings at Ajanta are in cave No. 9 and 10
    3. Later paintings at Ajanta by far the larger part of what survives was done between the mid 6th and 7th century A.D. and are in cave No. 1 and 2
    4. Scenes of Mahajanaka Jataka in cave No.1 are the best surviving examples of Ajanta paintings belonging to this period.
    5. painting of Bodhisatva Padmapani from cave 1 is one of the masterpieces of Ajanta Painting executed in the late 6th century A.D. 
    6. Along-side these Buddhist paintings there are also a **few Brahmanical figures of iconographic interest, such as Indra**
    7. Paintings from Bagh caves in Madhya Pradesh correspond to those paintings of Ajanta in cave No. 1 and 2. Stylistically both belong to the same form
2. Earliest Brahmanical paintings so far known, are the fragments found in Badami caves, in cave No.3 belonging to circa 6th century A.D. The so called Siva and Parvati is found somewhat well preserved.
    
    1. paintings of Ajanta, Bagh and Badami represent the classical tradition of the North and the Deccan at its best. Sittannavasal and other centers of paintings show the extent of its penetration in the South.
    2. Paintings of **Sittannavasal** are intimately connected with Jain themes and symbolism, but enjoy the same norm and technique as that of Ajanta. 
3. Next series of wall-painting to survive are at **Ellora, where a number of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain temples** were excavated between the 8th and 10th centuries A.D. from the living rock. The most impressive of these, the Kailashnath temple is a free standing structure which is in fact a monolith.
    
    1. the space, in the sense of Ajanta, therefore, does not exist at Ellora. So far as the style is concerned, **Ellora painting is a departure** from the classical norm of Ajanta paintings.
4. Most important wall paintings in South India are from Tanjore, Tamil Nadu. The dancing figures from **Rajarajeswara temples of Tanjore** belonging to early 11th century A.D. are beautiful examples of medieval paintings. 
    
    1. last series of wall painting in India are from **Lepakshi temple near Anantapur** belonging to 16th century AD,  illustrate Saivaite and scenes from Hindu texts.
5. Process of these paintings appears to have been the same in all the early examples that have survived with an only exception in the **Rajarajeshwara temple at Tanjore** which is supposed to be done in a **true fresco method** over the surface of the rock.
    
    1. Technique and process of **making Indian wall paintings which has been discussed in a special chapter of the Vishnudharamotaram,** a Sanskrit text of the 5th/6th century A.D.
    2. In true fresco method the paintings are done when the surface wall is still wet so that the **pigments go deep** inside the wall surface
    3. Tempora method of painting on the **lime plastered surface** which has been allowed to dry first and then **drenched with fresh lime water**
