    15. Early Medieval India
        
        1. No political unity in North India **for about 5 centuries after Harsha**. Number of states constantly fighting and changing frontiers.
            
            1. Rajput kingdoms - **rose from 7-8th AD and lasted till Muslim invasions.** Several theories of origin as this area witnessed a lot of foreign influence after decline of Magadha and practice of asserting themselves as **kshatriyas by foreigners** and indigenous groups and eventual assimilation.
            2. **Gurjara-Pratiharas** earliest of Rajput rulers. **Chauhans - most valiant Rajputs - were ruling in Delhi** when Muhammad Ghori came knocking. Constant fighting weakened the Rajputs. Their lack of political foresight and constant rivalries prevented any combined opposition to the Muslim invaders.
            3. Sind under Arabs - **expansion under the Umayyads and Abbasids caliphates**, led to conquest of Sind by Qasim. Resulted in diffusion of Indian culture abroad; **medicine and astronomy reaches Middle East along with number zero.**
        2. Mahmud of Ghazni - raided and plundered **India 17 times (997-1030 AD)**. Considered hero of Islam by medieval historians. His conquest of Punjab and Multan paved the way for the Turks and Afghans for further conquests and make deeper incursions into the Gangetic valley. He drained the resources of India by his repeated raids and deprived India of her manpower. The exhaustion of India’s economic resources and man power had its adverse effect on the political future of India. **Firdausi -** court poet who wrote **Shah Nama**. Al-baruni wrote Kitab-i-hind.
        3. Muhammad Ghori - **vassal of Ghaznavids** who became independent after his death and decline of that dynasty. Mahmud wanted to conquer India and extend his empire here. **First Battle of Tarain 1191 - Ghori v confederacy of Hindu** states under command of Prithviraj Chauhan; Ghori defeated. But returns with vengeance for the **second battle 1192 and claims a decisive victory;** PC executed. First Muslim kingdom in India established at Ajmer; **Qutbddin Aybak left behind to consolidate.** He does so by taking Delhi and Meerut. Slave dynasty rule begins.
        4. Causes of failure of Hindu kingdoms - were divided by factions. Secondly, many Hindu states were **declining in power.** Their military methods were out of date and **far inferior** to those of Muslims. Indians **continued** to **rely on elephants** while the Muslims possessed quick-moving cavalry. The Muslims soldiers had better organization and able leaders. Their **religious zeal and their greed** for the greater wealth of India provided stimulus to them. Among the Hindus, the duty of fighting was confined to a particular class, the Kshatriyas. **Always on the defensive**, which was always a weak position.
    16. Delhi Sultanate - Sultans considered themselves as a representative of Caliph and included him in his khutba (sermon) and coins.

            2. These liberal and unorthodox features of Sufism had a **profound influence on medieval Bhakti saints.** Akbar appreciated Sufi doctrines which shaped his religious outlook and religious policies. When the Sufi movement was becoming popular in India, about the same time the **Bhakti cult was gaining strength** among the Hindus. The two parallel movements based on the doctrines of **love and selfless devotion** contributed a great deal to bringing the two communities closer together.

            1. Factors responsible for religious tolerance - early contacts with the **sufi saints**, the teachings of his tutor Abdul Latif, his **marriage with Rajput women**, his association with **intellectual giants like Shaikh Mubarak** and his two illustrious sons – Abul Faizi and Abul Fazl – and his ambition to **establish an empire in Hindustan.**
            2. Started off his as a pious muslim, became skeptical one. **Disliked interference of ulemas**. Promulgated new monotheistic religion called **din-i-ilahi or divine faith**.

Faced serious difficulties in the latter part of his reign. The Jats and Satnamis and also the Sikhs revolted against him. These revolts were induced by his **harsh religious policy.** Rise of Marathas under Shivaji. Annexation of Golconda & Bijapur **to counter threat of Shivaji** put him in direct confrontation with him. It **depleted Mughal resources** and led to decline.

        2. The trading community did not belong to one caste or religion. The Gujarati merchants included the Hindus, Jains and Muslims. In Rajasthan, Oswals, Maheshwaris and Agarwals came to be called the Marwaris. Multanis, Khatris and Afghanis conducted trade with central Asia. In south India, the Chettis on the Coramandal coast and the Muslim merchants of Malabar were the most important trading communities. Balance of trade was maintained with import of gold and silver.

        6. **Baji Rao I** - The Maratha power reached its zenith under him. He initiated the **system of confederacy among the Maratha chiefs**.

        7. **Balaji Bajirao** (Nana Saheb) - Ahamdiya treaty was signed between the Marathas and Mughals.

            3. Third (1758-63) - due to Seven Years War in Europe. The French agreed to confine its activities in Pondicherry, Karaikkal, Mahe and Yenam. Thus the Anglo-French rivalry came to a close with **British success and French failure.**
        7. Start of British India
            
            1. Bengal remained one of the fertile and wealthy regions of India. The English ascendancy in Bengal proved to be the basis for the expansion of English rule in India. The conflict between the Nawab of Bengal, Siraj-ud-Daula and the English led to **Battle of Plassey 1757**. Robert Clive, the Commander of the British troops emerged victorious by defeating the Nawab’s army, because of the treachery of Mir Jafar, the Commander of Nawab’s army.
            2. **Battle of Buxar 1764** Nawab of Oudh, Bengal & Mughals face off English and face yet another defeat. **English military superiority** established, Robert Clive Governor General of Bengal 1765. Treaty of Allahabad signed which granted diwani rights to English East India Company.
      
      
    
2. **Tamil Nadu - Class 12**
    
    1. India under East India Company
        
        1. English East India Company was established on 31 December **1600 as per Royal Charter** issued by Elizabeth I. Captain Hawkins was sent to Jahangir in 1608 to establish a factory at Surat. He agreed eventually in 1613. Thomas Roe got more trading rights. 1639, Francis Day established city of Madras by constructing Fort St George. 1668 - Bombay was obtained on lease from Charles II for 10 pounds per year rent. In 1690 villages **Sutanuti, Govindpur and Kalikatta** were purchased and Fort William established by Job Charnock. These were three presidencies of Bombay, Madras & Calcutta. ￼**Warren Hastings** was 1st Governor General of Fort William.
        2. Warren Hastings - introduced the following reforms
            
            1. **Abolition of dual system** - which was introduced by Robert Clive. Company decided to act as diwan. Halved Nawab's allowance and stopped annual payment to Mughal emperor.
            2. **Revenue reforms** - Board of Revenue established, Accountant General appointed, Calcutta becomes capital of Bengal (and thus British India). Land auction for 5 years and safeguards taken to protect interests of peasants. **System was a failure.**
            3. **Judicial system** - Nawabs and judges were **highly corrupt and prejudiced.** Each district gets its **civil court under Collector and criminal court under Indian judge**. Appellate courts for both civil and criminal cases established. Sadar Diwani Adalat (civil) and Sadar Nizamat Adalat (criminal) were highest court of appeal. Code of Gentoo was translated from Persian into English by **N. B. Halhed.**
            4. Trade regulations - **abolished system of dastaks (free passes) and regulated internal trade.** Uniform tariff of 2.5% on Indian and non-Indian goods.
        3. Regulating Act of 1773 - opened new chapter in constitutional history of EIC. Home Govt consisted of Court of Directors and Court of Proprietors. Govt of presidency was conducted by a Governor and a Council, responsible to Home Govt. Why the Act was passed?
            
            1. Court of Directors' term increased to 4 years (from 1), with 1/4 retiring every year, no re-election
            2. Tenure of Governor General of Fort William to be of 5 years
            3. Council of 4 members to assist the Governor-General, govt conducted as per majority
            4. Governor-General in council made supreme over other Presidencies in matters of war and peace.
            5. 1774, Supreme Court of Calcutta established consisting of 4 judges. Independent of Governor-General in Council.
            6. Act prevented Company officials from receiving any cash or gift in kind.
        
        Merits - brought affairs of Company under Parliament control, put end to arbitrary rule of Company and provided framework for all future enactments. Demerits - made Governor-General in Council powerless and deadlock in decision making.
        
        5. Expansion under Warren Hastings -
            
            1. **Rohilla War 1774** - small kingdom bw Oudh and Marathas, who had taken Oudh protection against Marathas. But when they didn't pay, Nawab invaded with the help of British.
            2. **1st Anglo-Maratha War 1775-82** - Marathas were disunited since 3rd Battle of Panipat 1761. Dispute for the post of Peshwa between Madhav Rao and his uncle Ragunatha Rao was best utilized by British. Raghunatha Rao promised to cede Bassein and Salsette to British under Treaty of Surat 1775 to get restored to Poona.  British Calcutta Council under Warren Hastings annulled this treaty and a new treaty, the Treaty of Purandhar was signed in 1776 between the Calcutta Council and Nana Phadnavis, a Maratha minister. Raghunathrao was given a pension only and Madhav Rao II was accepted as Peshwa. **But the British establishment at Bombay violated this treaty and sheltered Raghunathrao.** In 1777, Nana Phadnavis went against his treaty with the Calcutta Council and granted a port on the west coast to the French. In 1782, the Treaty of Salbai was signed between Warren Hastings and Mahadaji Scindia, resulting in Maratha victory.
                
                1. The **Treaty of Salbai** established the British influence in Indian politics. Treaty also enabled the British to exert pressure on Mysore with the help of the Marathas in recovering their territories from Haider Ali. Thus, the British, on the one hand, saved themselves from the combined opposition of Indian powers and on the other, succeeded in dividing the Indian powers.
            3. **Second Anglo-Mysore War** 1780-82 - First was in 1767-69 in which Haider Ali defeated British. Why second one happened?
                
                1. British didn't fulfil terms of defensive treaty they signed when Haider was attacked by Marathas
                2. Outbreak of hostilities bw French and British due to American War of Independence.
                3. British captured Mahe, which was a French settlement within Haider's territories.
                4. Haider was working on a grand alliance bw Hyderabad, Marathas and Mysore against British
            
            War began when British tried capturing Guntur. Haider Ali defeated British in 1780 but Hastings divided the confederacy, isolating Haider Ali. He was defeated in 1781, and died in 1782 of cancer. War came to an end with Treaty of Mangalore 1784 which restored the status quo ante bellum.
            
        6. Pitt's India Act 1784 - as Regulating Act failed in its objective, Pitt's India Act was passed in 1784. Main provisions
            
            1. **Board of Control of 6 members**, appointed by crown
            2. Court of Directors retained without any alteration in its composition.
            3. Reduced number of members of **Governor General's Council from 4 to 3.**
        7. **Pitt's India Act was rude shock to Warren Hastings.** His image was tarnished due to PM's view of policy of Govt of Bengal and hence left India in 1785. He was impeached in the Parliament for judicial murder of Nanda Kumar and other 21 charges. He was acquitted after a long trial in 1795. Under Hastings's term as governor-general, a great deal of **administrative precedent was set which profoundly shaped later attitudes** towards the government of British India. Hastings had a great respect for the ancient scripture of Hinduism and set the British position on governance as one of looking back to the earliest precedents possible. This in turn allowed Hindu caste system to accentuate which will till now more flexibly applied. He retains the strange distinction of being both the **architect of British India** and the one ruler of British India to whom the **creation of such an entity was anathema.**
    2. Lord Cornwallis (1786-1793)
        
        1. Was offered Governor-Generalship in India after return from American War, he was a warrior-statesman. Cornwallis was prompted by a strong sense of public duty and enjoyed the respect as well as the confidence of his fellow countrymen. New tradition of choosing a person from an aristocratic family for the post of Governor-General was initiated with Cornwallis.
        2. **Third Mysore War -** The Treaty of Mangalore (1784) exhibited the military strength of Mysore, exposed English weaknesses and increased Tipu’s strength. Like his father he wanted to eliminate the English from India. Causes:
            
            1. Tipu was gaining strength on back of internal reforms, causing Nizam, Marathas and British to worry.
            2. Tipu sent envoys to French and Turkey to seek their help
            3. Expanded territories at the cost of Travancore, ally of British.
            4. In 1789, British concluded tripartite alliance with Nizam and Marathas against Tipu.
        
        Conclusion - ended in Tipu's defeat with him giving up half his dominion, war indemnity of 3 crores and 2 sons as hostage. Treaty of Srirangapattinam signifies a shift in fortunes for British in South India where they secured large territory on Malabar Coast. Cornwallis could defeat Tipu with significant help from Marathas.
        
        4. Reforms of Cornwallis -
            
            1. Administrative - purification of civil service by employment of honest civil servants. Abolished the vicious system of paying small salaries and allowing enormous perquisites. Appointment on basis of merit, laying foundation of Indian Civil Service. Separation of the three branches of service, commercial, judicial and revenue.
            2. Judicial - with help of William Jones. Top courts were Sadar Diwani Adalat and Sadar Nizamat Adalat, presided over Governor-General in Council. 4 provincial court at Calcutta, Dhaka, Murshidabad and Patna, each under 3 European judges. District courts under a European judge, who was not the Collector. Indian judges (munsiffs) appointed to bottom courts. All officials answerable to courts. In civil cases, Hindu and Muslim laws were followed according to the religion of the litigants.
            3. Police - District judge controlled the police, each district divided into police circles headed by daroga.
            4. Permanent Settlement (Zamindari) -  previous experiment of Izaredar system was based on annual assessment of revenue. To streamline the revenues of the company, Cornwallis changed the settlement schedule from annual to decennial (10 years). In the permanent settlement, the company recognized them as owners of soil. They were given permanent hereditary rights to collect revenue. Zamindars were allowed to keep force and maintain order in their districts. They were expected to improve the conditions of the tenants but the company would not interfere in their internal dealings with the tenants so long they paid the fixed land revenue.
        5. He discharged his duties fearlessly, and his life was an embodiment of ‘duty and sacrifice’. He perceived the danger of Tipu’s growing power and curtailed it by boldly discarding the policy of nonintervention. As an administrator, he consolidated the Company’s position in India and started the tradition of efficient and pure administration. John Shore was his successor, uneventful as he adopted a policy of non-intervention.
    3. Wellesley (1798-1805)
        
        1. He was a great imperialist and called himself ‘a Bengal tiger’. Wellesley came to India with a determination to launch a forward policy in order to make ‘the British Empire in India’ into ‘the British Empire of India’. The system that he adopted to achieve his object is known as the ‘Subsidiary Alliance’. Marathas were a formidable power, Nizam was getting his army trained by French and Tipu was the disavowed enemy. Given his predecessor's policy affected British prestige and fear of Napoleon in larger context, led him to his two aims - preservation of British prestige and removal of French danger from India were Wellesley’s twin aims.
        2. Subsidiary alliance - building on previous alliances:
            
            1. Indian ruler who entered into the subsidiary alliance with the British had to maintain a contingent of British troops in his territory. It was commanded by a British officer. The Indian state was called ‘the protected state’ and the British hereinafter were referred to as ‘the paramount power’.
            2. Protected state to cut off its connection with European powers other than the English and with the French in particular.
            3. Ruler of the protected state to keep a British Resident at court and disband own army, no employment to any non-British European without approval, enter into agreements and engage in warfare with British permission. Led to unemployment of thousands of soldiers.
        
        This system is regarded as masterstroke of British imperialism. Increased military strength of Company at expense of protected states. Rulers of protected states neglected administrative responsibilities leading easy going lives; misgovernment followed. Heavy payments for getting protection took toll on economy.
        
        4. Enforcement of subsidiary system
            
            1. Hyderabad - first state to get under the subsidiary system in 1798.
            2. Oudh - threat of invasion by Zaman Shah was pretext for Wellesley to force Nawab to enter subsidiary treaty. British could frame rules and regulations in name of maintaining law and order.
            3. Tanjore, Surat and Karnatak - in all these places British took over administration by paying pension to the rulers and letting them retain their titles.
        5. Fourth Mysore War 1799 -
            
            1. Tipu wanted to avenge his defeat and terms imposed upon him by British. He took efforts to seek the help of the France, Arabia, Kabul and Turkey. He corresponded with Napoleon, who had arrived in Egypt promising to liberate British India. At Srirangapattinam, a Jacobian Club was started and the flag of the French Republic was hoisted. The tree of Liberty was also planted.
            2. Wellesley set out to persuade Tipu to accept a pact of subsidiary alliance and asked Tipu to dismiss the French, to receive an English envoy, and to make terms with the Company and its allies. Tipu paid no attention to Wellesley and thus the war started. Tipu fought till his capital Srirangapattinam was captured and was shot dead. The Wodeyar dynasty was restored on the throne of the Mysore and Mysore came indirectly under the British.
        6. Marathas - Nana Fadnavis provided the leadership to the Marathas. He was responsible for the preservation of independence of his country from the onslaught of the British. **By helping Cornwallis against Tipu he was able to acquire a large slice of territory from Mysore. His death in 1800 removed the last great Maratha leader.** After that in-fighting among leaders proved self-destructive. Scindia and Peshwa battled against Holkar in some internal dispute which Holkar won. Peshwa Baji Rao II fled and signed Treaty of Bassein 1802 with British. Marathas considered the treaty as a document of surrendering their independence.
        7. Second Maratha War 1803-05 -
            
            1. Daulat Rao Scindia and Raghoji Bhonsle took the **Treaty of Bassein as an insult to the national honor of the Marathas.** Soon the forces of both the chieftains were united, but Wellesley defeated their combined forces. **Treaty of Deogaon and Treaty of Surji-Arjungaon** were signed by Marathas.
        8. Wellesley was an unscrupulous annexationist and an advocate of forward policy, he was one of the greatest empire-builders that England had ever produced. Located the weak spot of Indian rulers and applied his subsidiary alliance. He turned East India Company from a trading corporation into an imperial power.
        
        George Barlow (1805-1807) - Vellore Mutiny of 1806 (because of dress code change and apparent forced conversion to Christianity). ￼Lord Minto (1807-13) - Treaty of Amritsar with Ranjit Singh of Punjab in 1809.
        
    4. **Lord Hastings (1813-1823)**
        
        1. Followed path set up by Wellesley - forward policy and extensive wars. When he assumed power, anarchy in central India - Pindaris plundering whole region and Marathas plagued with infighting couldn't control them. He went to war against Marathas and Gurkhas to eliminate threats to British power.
        2. Anglo Gorkha War (1814-16) - Nepal emerged as powerful Gorkha state in 1768. British bought districts of Gorakhpur and Basti from Nawab of Oudh and had border skirmishes with Gorkhas that culminated in war. War ended with **Treaty of Sagauli** and Gorkhas gave up their claims of Terai, Kumaon and Garhwal and Sikkim.
        3. Pindaris - origin is unknown. Irregular Muslim horsemen (defeated Mughal soldiers) captured by Marathas that plundered and foraged with the Maratha armies in central India. Served without payment but allowed to plunder. They never helped the British. Lord Hastings resolved to suppress the Pindaris, successfully by 1818.
        4. Downfall of Marathas - The relationships of powerful Maratha chiefs like the Bhonsle, Gaekwar, Scindia, Holkar and the Peshwa were **ridden with mutual jealousies**. Treaty of Poona 1817 - **Baji Rao II forced to give up his dream** of becoming the supreme head of Marathas. ￼Third Maratha War - But soon the Peshwa undid this treaty with the British and on 5 November 1817 **attacked the British Residency**. He was defeated at a place called Kirkee. Similarly, the Bhonsle chief, Appa Sahib also refused to abide by the Treaty of Nagpur, which he had signed with the British on 17 May 1816. According to this treaty, Nagpur came under the control of the Company. He fought with the British in the Battle of Sitabaldi in November 1817, but was defeated. The Peshwa now turned to Holkar for help, but Holkar too was defeated by the British on 21 December 1817 at Baroda. Therefore, by December 1817 the dream of a Mighty Maratha Confederacy was finally shattered.
        5. Causes of defeat of Marathas
            
            1. Lack of capable **leadership**
            2. Military **weakness** of Marathas
            3. Mutual bitterness and lack of **cooperation** amongst themselves
            4. No positive impact on conquered territories by way of **governance**
            5. Not cordial relationship with other princes or Nawabs - **fighting on all fronts**
            6. Failed to estimate the **political and diplomatic strength** of British
        6. Reforms of Hastings - approved Ryotwari system (introduced by Thomas Munro in Madras). **Hastings encouraged the foundation of vernacular schools by missionaries and others. He encouraged the freedom of press and abolished the censorship introduced in 1799.** The Bengali Weekly, Samachar Darpan was started in 1818 by Marshman, a Serampore missionary.
    5. **Lord William Bentinck** (1828-35) - initiated era of progress and reforms. William Bentinck adopted a policy of **non-intervention and non-aggression** with Indian states. If at all he interfered in the affairs of the Indian states, it was only to end any form of misgovernment and never to annex any territory.
        
        1. **Charter Act of 1833** - Regulating Act 1773 made it compulsory to renew Company Charter every 20 years. Significance -
            
            1. Liberal and utilitarian philosophy of Bentham was made popular with this
            2. EIC ceased to be a commercial agency but political agent of Crown
            3. Governor General of Fort William was now Governor General of India (and Lord Bentinck was the first one)
            4. Law member appointed to Governor-General in Council, Macaulay was 1st one
            5. Act allowed native Indians to hold employment and office, thus Indianization of public service
        2. Reforms of Bentinck - ushered in new era in annals of India
            
            1. **Financial** - were weak when he came in, reduced salaries and allowances. Abolished system of double batta (allowance to troops on active service).
            2. **Administrative** - abolished provincial courts of appeal established by Cornwallis. Introduction of local languages in lower courts and English in higher courts instead of Persian. Revenue settlements of North West Province under RM Bird, period of 30 years made with tillers or landowners.
            3. **Social reforms** - Abolition of sati in 1829 in Bengal and 1830 rest of presidencies. Suppression of thugs, who were hereditary robbers, by William Sleeman, aka Thuggee Sleeman. Declared female infanticide as punishable crime.
            4. **English education** - introduction of English education. Macaulay emphasized the promotion of European literature and science through English medium to the people of India. This recommendation was wholeheartedly accepted by Bentinck. The Government Resolution in 1835 made English the official and literary language of India.
    6. **Lord Dalhousie**
        
        1. Youngest Governor General of India. Used different **policy of annexation but saw himself ending misrule**. At the same time he had in his mind the advantages of annexation to the British such as imperial defense, commercial and financial benefits. His great annexations include Punjab, Lower Burma, most of the Central Provinces and Awadh.
        2. **Annexed Punjab after 2nd Anglo Sikh War in 1849**, and moved to rule it efficiently. Revenue and judicial departments combined, law and procedure simplified as per custom of people.
        3. **Doctrine of Lapse** - took every opportunity to take over kingdoms by peaceful means. Dalhousie maintained that there was a difference in principle between the **right to inherit private property and the right to govern**. This principle was called the Doctrine of Lapse. Kingdoms taken - Satara, Jhansi, Nagpur. Withdrawn after 1857.
        4. **Awadh** - Mismanagement by ruling Nawabs eventually led to British annexation even though they were already a British protectorate. This offended Muslim elite (who lost prestige) and many sepoys who came from Awadh.
        5. **Administration** - His greatest achievement was the molding of the **new provinces into a modern centralized state.** For the newly acquired territories, he introduced the centralized control called “Non-Regulation System”, which appointed a Commissioner.
        6. **Railways** - British introduced Railways in India for three purposes - administration, commercial interests and defense. Guaranteed 5% return to them and govt buying of railway at the end of contract period.
        7. **Telegraph & Post** - About 4000 miles long telegraph lines were laid before the departure of Dalhousie. During the 1857 Revolt, the system of telegraphic communication proved a boon for the English and the military value of Dalhousie’s creation was much realized at that time. Foundation of modern postal system was laid down, Post Office Act was passed in 1854.
        8. **Education** - Educational Dspatch of **Sir Charles Wood (1854)** was considered the “Intellectual Charter of India”. Provided an outline for the comprehensive scheme of education at primary, secondary and collegiate levels. Dalhousie fully accepted the views of Charles Wood and took steps to carry out the new scheme. The Universities of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras were founded in 1857.
        9. He created a separate **Public Works Department** and allotted more funds for cutting canals and roads. The Upper Ganges Canal was completed in 1854. Many bridges were constructed.
        10. Estimate - He introduced the process of modernization of India. Hence, he is hailed as **“the maker of modern India”.** However, his **policy of annexation** came to be one of the direct causes of the mutiny.
    7. British Administration and economic policy of British -
        
        1. During Kingship, land was divided into Jagirs, Jagirs were allotted to Jagirdars, who split the land they got and allocated to sub-ordinate Zamindars. They made peasants cultivate the land, in-return collected part of their revenue as tax.
        2. British Agrarian Policy - India primarily agricultural country. Till 18th century, strong relation bw agriculture and cottage industries. British destroyed handicraft industry while unleashing changes in agrarian structures by introducing new systems of land tenures and policies of revenue administration. India's economic dominance revolved around agriculture which British ruthlessly exploited.
        3. Permanent Settlement 1793 by Lord Cornwallis - introduced in Bengal, then in Bihar and Odisha. Hastings introduced annual lease system of auctioning land to highest bidder. Shore and Grant were consulted by Cornwallis in coming up with this. Features:
            
            1. Zamindars recognized owners of land, till they pay revenue to EIC regularly
            2. Amount of revenue firmly fixed and not raised. Govt got 89% (10/11 parts)
            3. Ryots became tenants
            4. Settlement took away administrative and judicial functions of zamindars
            
            1. No attempt was made to survey land and assess its value.
            2. Effects on both zamindar and ryots were disastrous. Many zamindars defaulted, some entrusted collection to agents who took illegal taxes from ryots.
            3. Idea of building benevolent land-lord system failed. Company faced losses in long term because land productivity was high. However, zamindars prospered at the cost of welfare of tenants.
        4. Ryotwari settlement 1820 - by Munro. Introduced in Madras, later Bombay & Assam.
            
            1. Peasant was recognized as proprietor of land. No intermediary such as zamindar.
            2. Revenue paid in time = peasant not evicted. Peasant directly responsible. 50% dry lands, 60% irrigated lands.
            3. Land revenue fixed from 20 to 40 years
        
        However, collection officials indulged in harsh measures hence system not successful.
        
        6. Mahalwari settlement - introduced in Punjab in 1833 (Bentick) and subsequently in North/Central.
            
            1. Basic unit of revenue settlement was village. Joint responsibility of paying revenue with entire mahal.
            2. Entire land of village measured when fixing revenue.
            3. Eliminated middlemen, but benefit enjoyed by govt not peasants
        7. Handicrafts policy - trade monopoly ended by Charter Act 1833.
            
            1. Textiles were most important among Indian industries. Muslin of Dhaka, carpets of Lahore, shawls of Kashmir, embroidery of Benaras were famous. Important centers were - Krishnanagar, Chanderi, Arni, Benaras.
            2. Shipping, leather and metal industries along with cutting and polishing of marbles and precious stones.
            
            1. Indian market flooded with cheap imports from Britain - which had sought to develop India as a colony market to balance its trade deficit. Import duty of 2.5% imposed cotton, while 15% on Indian cotton.
            2. Goods from England can only be brought by English ships => Indian textiles couldn’t enter British market.
            3. Domestic demand for luxury goods reduced as British paramountcy curtailed expenditure of royals and nobles.
            4. Industrial revolution in Britain made their products cheaper and faster to produce and sought to develop a mass market in India. ￼

From govt records - 1 school for 400 people in Bengal, similar for whole of India.
        2. EIC adopted a dual policy, discouraged indigenous education system and gave importance to western and English education. Charter Act of 1813 gave Rs 1 lakh to spread of education. However was mired in debate, hence not spent. British scholars were divided into Orientalists and Anglicists. William Bentick emphasized the latter when he became G-G in 1829.

However from mid-19th century, various campaigns launched against social evils attracted attention of govt.

            2. Caste related legislation - by 19th century, castes of India had split into innumerable sub-castes on basis of birth.
                
                1. Gandhi made removal of untouchability a part of his constructive program, through paper called The Harijan and organized Harijan Sevak Sangh

            3. Sepoys earlier served local chieftains but now served foreigners.
            4. Mutineers proclaims son of Tipu as new ruler.
        2. Aftermath - Vellore Mutiny failed. There was no proper leadership. The rebellion was also not well organized. But it is the starting point of a new era of the resistance of the sepoys to the British rule. The 18th century was marked by the resistance of the local chieftains. The first six decades of 19th century was marked by the resistance of sepoys.￼
    10. Great Revolt of 1857 - sowed seeds of Indian nationalism. Vir Savarkar hailed it 1st War of Indian Independence.

        Plantation system caused incalculable misery for Indian peasants as Englishmen acquired and plantations in India.
        
        4. Social causes - arrogant behavior of Englishmen, activities of Christian missionaries alarmed Hindus and Muslims.
        5. Military causes - Indian sepoys resented their low salary and poor prospects of promotion, dissatisfaction with abolition of batta (foreign allowance).
        6. Immediate cause - was the rumor that new cartridges whose end had to be bitten off before loaded into rifle was composed of fat taken from cows and pigs. Sepoys believed govt was deliberately trying to destroy religious and cultural identity.
        7. Timeline of revolt
            
            1. March 1857 - Mangal Pandey refused to use the cartridges and attacked and killed his officer; was hanged. Regiment disbanded and sepoys held guilty of rebeliion
