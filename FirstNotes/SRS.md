An **SRS (Software Requirements Specification) Document Validator** is a tool or system designed to **automatically evaluate** the quality, completeness, consistency, and correctness of an SRS document. The core idea is to minimize human oversight errors during requirement gathering and ensure that the document adheres to both **formal standards** (e.g., IEEE 830/29148) and **project-specific quality metrics**.

## üí° Concept Overview: SRS Document Validator

### **Objective**

Develop a system that analyzes an SRS document to:

- **Detect ambiguities**, inconsistencies, incompleteness.
    
- **Validate format compliance** against standards like IEEE 830 or IEEE 29148.
    
- Provide **quantitative and qualitative metrics** for requirements quality.
    
- **Support traceability** and version control.
    
- Offer **recommendations** for improving the specification.

## üß† Key Features

1. **Linguistic Analysis**
    
    - Identify vague terms ("fast", "efficient", "user-friendly").
        
    - Detect passive voice, weak verbs, and non-verifiable statements.
        
    - Use NLP to parse and analyze sentence structure for clarity and testability.
        
2. **Requirement Classification**
    
    - Automatically classify requirements into functional, non-functional, constraints, assumptions, etc.
        
    - Validate that each requirement includes necessary fields: ID, description, priority, source.
        
3. **Consistency & Conflict Detection**
    
    - Detect logical contradictions between requirements.
        
    - Highlight duplicated or conflicting statements.
        
4. **Completeness Checker**
    
    - Ensure all major sections of SRS are present (e.g., purpose, scope, system features, external interface requirements).
        
    - Check that all referenced diagrams, figures, or modules are included.
        
5. **Standard Compliance Validation**
    
    - Validate against IEEE 830 / 29148 formatting and structure.
        
    - Check for missing traceability matrices, glossary, assumptions, dependencies.
        
6. **Traceability Matrix Generator**
    
    - Map requirements to design elements, test cases, and stakeholder origins.
        
    - Automatically update as changes occur.
        
7. **Change Impact Analysis**
    
    - When a requirement is modified, analyze and display impacted downstream items.
        
8. **Quality Metrics Dashboard**
    
    - Display coverage percentage, ambiguity score, completeness score.
        
    - Provide warnings or flags for items needing review.

## üèóÔ∏è Possible Architecture

- **Frontend:** Web-based UI to upload/view documents and reports.
    
- **Backend:**
    
    - **Parser Module** (e.g., for .docx/.pdf/.md/.txt).
        
    - **NLP Engine** (spaCy, NLTK, or transformers-based).
        
    - **Rules Engine** (custom or using business rules frameworks).
        
    - **Standards Validator** (mapped to IEEE rules).
        
    - **Database** for document versions, user actions, and traceability maps.
        
- **Optional:** Integration with tools like JIRA, GitHub, or test management systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Tech Stack Suggestions

- Python (NLP with spaCy, transformers, etc.)
    
- Flask/Django + React for web interface.
    
- MongoDB/PostgreSQL for data.
    
- PDFMiner / python-docx for document parsing.
    
- OpenAI / LLM-based classifiers for ambiguity and classification.

## üîç Use Cases

- Internal QA teams validating product requirements.
    
- Vendor contract review for specification quality.
    
- Academic/educational settings teaching SRS quality.
    
- Pre-audit checks in regulated industries (healthcare, aerospace, finance).

If you're building this, would you want it as a **standalone tool**, an **integrated plugin** for existing document editors or platforms (like MS Word, JIRA), or as a **cloud service**? That decision will heavily shape architecture and complexity. I can sketch out the system architecture or implementation plan depending on your direction.
